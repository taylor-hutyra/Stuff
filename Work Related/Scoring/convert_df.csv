0,8784599,0,Job well done!
1,8786577,0,"Great topic and interesting how impactful this study is. Presenter was very knowledgeable and passionate about the research and the implications. Poster was clean, organized, and easy to follow. Great info."
2,8786577,1,Very professional and good topic
3,8786577,2,"Overall very interesting. Would have liked to see a more extensive reference list and review of literature. Great, impactful study."
4,8786578,0,Excellent presenter! Ms. Jackson knows her stuff and is very passionate about the research. The experimental design is very good and the study is very relevant and applicable to multiple non-ruminant species. This preliminary data warrants further investigation of caprine casein as a prebiotic.
5,8786579,0,Good explanation of the results! Would have been good to try to fill in more of the white space on the poster by making some of the images and figures better. Needed to provide more detail about how many plants were used and what age the plants were as there may be differences in chemical composition between young and mature plants.
6,8786579,1,Good
7,8786580,0,"There were a couple typos in the abstract and an incomplete sentence. It would have been good to include some specific results in the abstract. Separating the materials away from the methods on the poster made things a little confusing. Once I asked questions about the experiment setup and analysis, things were more clear."
8,8786580,1,"Very impressive speaker; confident, knowledgeable and passionate about her work. The experimental design was presented on the poster vaguely; unclear how replications and how treatment was applied. However, Ms. Long was able to clarify methods during Q&A portion of presentation. There were minor typos on the poster. Overall-well done."
9,8786582,0,"Poster - boxes help organize material. Graphics are appropriate. Too much text in paragraph form; aim for large font bullet points instead. Presentation - confident,  slow pace for comprehension.  Abstract - language is simplistic and somewhat unprofessional. Later in abstract some grammatical errors."
10,8786582,1,The results and methods were very clear! Great job of explaining the project! Good use of poster space and color. The abstract had a couple typos/ grammar issues but that is my only complaint.
11,8786582,2,Experimental design was hard to follow. Explanation for low yield of conventional treatment compared to control.
12,8786582,3,Good presentation. Enthusiastic.
13,8786583,0,There were a couple typos in the abstract and on the poster but the content was really good!
14,8786584,0,Why include abstract on a poster since it is already a summary. Reduce verbiage by sixty to seventy percent to avoid viewer fatigue. Replace with more blank space larger images.
15,8786584,1,Not really a research project but good work in what is being put together.
16,8786585,0,Excellent and very relevant information.  Good luck getting it to those in need.
17,8786586,0,Interesting follow up study and impressive for a freshman student. Mr. Time presented well; was confident and passionate about his work.
18,8786586,1,Include stats in abstract. Do not include abstract on poster. Poster is already an abstract. Use that space for more images etc. Use less verbiage/text on poster and more space/images. During oral presentation speak more loudly and go through poster systematically. Also be more familiar with methods such as stats.
19,8786586,2,Impressive that Edward is only a freshman!
20,8786587,0,An abstract in a poster clutters and takes space from interesting images etc. avoid too much verbiage/text in a poster; keep it simple and interesting so viewers are not fatigued by having to read too much. Viewers have short attention spans after looking at dozens of posters. Use more images and space. Also speak up during oral since acoustics are poor in most poster halls.
21,8786587,1,Presenter was knowledgeable but talked too fast.  Might help to use poster and focus on different sections in explanation.   Quality of the work is good but explanation could be improved.
22,8786588,0,Suggest not including abstract on poster. Poster is an abstract. Reduce verbiage overall to avoid reader fatigue.
23,8786588,1,Interesting topic. Great presentation.
24,8786588,2,Impressive presentation.
25,8786589,0,Good explanation of study background and methods! Make results figures larger. Would be good to have a couple lines on the poster about results and main study findings.
26,8786589,1,"The visuals on the poster could have been larger regarding data and information.  Photos,  though eye catching, were larger but didn't contribute much."
27,8786589,2,Poster could be organized better by using bullets in the Introduction section with larger font size. Title should be in larger fonts and abstract moved to one side instead of mixing up with the title.
28,8786590,0,This was a fun poster and the student was well spoken and excited about her work. There was very little on the poster and more detail/implications could have been added
29,8786591,0,Good presentation.  I liked the visuals that your poster included.  That helped me understand more about your project.
30,8786591,1,Very good work.  Understood research and process.  Obviously very involved in project.
31,8786591,2,Very nice job - really! No major comments
32,8786592,0,Fielded questions well. Interesting. Good photos.
33,8786593,0,Scales in x and y axes would increase the quality of the poster.
34,8786593,1,Great project!
35,8786593,2,She did great answering questions and opened up regarding her knowledge of the system. There were several spelling errors on the poster and lack axis labels.
36,8786594,0,Very good work.  Exceptional in thinking through issues encountered in project.
37,8786594,1,The great thing is that I learned so much about deer! My suggestion is that when giving a poster stick to the info on the poster and choose the extra info wisely...most people have only 5-10 min attention span so make sure that on those first 5-10 minutes you make the main points of your research :)
38,8786594,2,"She was extraodinarily enthusiastic. However it was very difficult to follow the presentation and determine goals, outcomes and conclusions."
39,8786595,0,Presenter very soft spoken. More data needed. Good poster.
40,8786595,1,It would have been nice to see additional data such as frequency on certain plants and perhaps when some bees were found versus others over the course of the weeks.  I find that even simple data can begin to tell us cool things.
41,8786596,0,Great project!  Good luck on the next phase with the boars.
42,8786596,1,Good work.  Very knowledgeable.
43,8786597,0,"Great job on your project.  I'll be interested to learn about your final results once you have a chance to analyze your data.  

Good luck!"
44,8786597,1,A nice pilot study. Enthusiastic and well spoken
45,8786598,0,Excellent job on your presentation.  Very interesting project.
46,8786598,1,"More visuals would be helpful. Interesting study, would recommend more formal sampling method"
47,8786598,2,"I always say that a graph on a poster is the quickest way to convey information - even though the data were relatively simple, a bar graph would be a quick way to show that there were no significance can’t differences among the 3 methods.  Another thing that would have been cool Is to show a sample page of the test and the content of the video.  The enthusiasm on direction of the student was great."
48,8786599,0,Excellent work.  Very involved and knowledgeable.
49,8786599,1,"It looks like the abstract has been updated since it was submitted for the conference.  The results changed from CAST 1 to CAST 2.  Glad to see the updated version on the poster. 

Excellent job presenting!  Very interesting work."
50,8786599,2,Well put together.
51,8786601,0,"Poster - appealing, well formatted. Make the linkage mal larger and indicate location of protein on interest. Presentation - confident, good pace, explained everything clearly."
52,8786602,0,Very engagi g. Answered questions well.
53,8786602,1,Great poster. Very engaging. Answered questions.
54,8786602,2,Good poster. Enthusiastic presentation.
55,8786602,3,"- Did a really good job of explaining your project!
-Your abstract did a good job of summarizing the work but there were a few typos and run-on sentences.
-It would have been good to specify that your graphs only represented results from a couple of months.
-Specify if results were averaged across all months or were only for one particular month."
56,8786603,0,"Me. Preston did a great job presenting the research. She was confident and delivered the material well. She understood the research model, how the results could be implication in the industry and where future research in this area is needed. Well done."
57,8786604,0,"Very interesting study! The student was a little vague on some areas of the experimental design. Further, she seems to be less confident when explaining implication the study’s findings have for cattle producers. Overall, she is fine and the study has good results that can be used as pilot data for future studies."
58,8786605,0,"Use more vibrant, distinctive colors in design"
59,8786605,1,"Study is off to a good start but still not clear on the focus. It appears to be an early exploratory study and should dig deeper into measuring effectiveness.
Due to pre-data analysis stage, I'm not clear on hypothesis development."
60,8786606,0,Very important topic. Good start on the research. My only criticism is that it's early stage and must be developed.  The students seemed enthusiastic and engaged in the topic.  I expect that this will turn into something outstanding if they keep up the work.
61,8786607,0,Presenter was not at poster; more details needed about development
62,8786607,1,Student was not available
63,8786607,2,"While I saw the poster, student was not present at the 2 times I passed by. I waited 5 minutes each time.  The small print was very hard to read."
64,8786609,0,Zdenek Tronicek
65,8786609,1,Das you had excellent eye contact and were very poised when you presented. You came across both very professional in your dress and your presentation. Your voice was a little soft so feel free to speak up! Your poster was well balanced with information and was very clear. Best wishes on your future endeavors.
66,8786609,2,Not clear the source of data and software to analysis the data from excell.
67,8786610,0,Abstract a little long and detailed; try to summarize and make more succinct.
68,8786610,1,"Many grammatical errors on poster...commas, spacing, etc. references should not be numbered. I think A & M should not be spelled “and”."
69,8786612,0,Swagata you did an excellent job on your presentation and you knew your material so well! What an exciting time to data collect since the policy has changed. My only minor suggestion is some of your charts were hard to read because they printed light-but that may not could be helped. Great job!
70,8786612,1,Some content on posture was hard to see due to size. Great information and data collection.
71,8786613,0,"interesting presentation
strong knowledge of the topic
more info about how the changes in education tie into the job market would be helpful"
72,8786613,1,Ajogu did a fantastic job walking me through his poster. He was poised and knowledgeable on his content. I thought the charts and graphs were appropriate and well laid out. Great job! One of the very best poster presentations I have judged this year!
73,8786613,2,Delmer nagy
74,8786614,0,Add references
75,8786614,1,excellent presentation of the material
76,8786615,0,Great job.
77,8786615,1,One word use error on poster and try to slow down speaking rate. Excellent work!
78,8786617,0,Poster was difficult to read because graphs and such were so small. Maybe make raw data chart much smaller in order to make room for other things to be larger. Great project and you are obviously excited about your topic and findings. Very useful info for the sport management world. Would have been neat if you could have provided some examples of how participating universities have implemented changes based on your research. It was a little difficult to hear at times but think it was partly because the room was fairly noisy.  Be careful with some grammar issues in the abstract. Nicely done.
79,8786617,1,"You had great information. With so much information, some material was very small."
80,8786617,2,"Very well done. In presenting your poster you were confident and professional. Well done in answering questions, explaining your research, methods, and implications.

I did not see any citations of sources. Is there other research which would help support your conclusion?

The poster was well organized, and attractive (the colors made the information stand out).
However it was difficult to read the information on the chart. Most likely a higher resolution is needed.

Overall well done and a very interesting topic."
81,8786618,0,"Great project!  I look forward to seeing what the data reveals when you analyze it by country.  

Good luck!"
82,8786619,0,Great job. Keep it up
83,8786619,1,It would have been good to include some of the specific results that you found in the abstract itself. Good job of presenting the information!
84,8786621,0,"You did a great job of discussing the experience and some of the information you found related to internships. I would have liked to see more background research supporting the completion of internships! There is information out there. Also, if you had such a good experience that the company obviously appreciated, it would be good to show some kind of information that you compiled to present to your university department on the value of adding an internship as a degree requirement. Incorporate more research to support the good that you discovered because as you said, every internship is different. Since they are different, are the majority of them going to be worth requiring? I certainly believe so but show us!! Nice job of introducing yourself and having a good presence when you present."
85,8786621,1,Overall good. Might consider decreasing picture size so it’s not so pixalated.
86,8786621,2,Consider putting the abstract first instead of last. Your experience with an internship will definitely help once you complete your degree. Great job.
87,8786625,0,"Oral presentation did not match abstract well. Poster was not visually appealing (all text just black and white). Even bullets would have improved the poster by focusing succinctly on the main points. Never use casual register (such as contractions) when presenting scholarly work. This project has the potential to be a good study, but I had to ask for information about the methodology, et cetera."
88,8786625,1,Research in progress so there is no data. Presenter did a good job of providing a detailed overview of the research along with further research implications.
89,8786625,2,Great proposal and presenter did a fantastic interaction with audience. Showed her passion on this topic. Nice job!
90,8786625,3,Presenter was late to session. Way too much narrative on the poster. Research just beginning. Presenter seemed uninterested to in sharing project.
91,8786629,0,I suggest labeling conclusions
92,8786630,0,Would liked to have seen results. Interesting study!
93,8786631,0,Very interesting!
94,8786632,0,"Poster is very easy to understand and use of good graphical representation helps explain findings; student has impressive knowledge about study details and relation to mathematical cognition field and did a great job of answering a diverse set of questions; abstract seems to be missing one of the points emphasized in the presentation, though -- effect of endpoints.  I was glad to see how excited the student was to talk about the presented research and potential future studies."
95,8786632,1,She may want to work on explaining SOM and the importance of this work and its applications to the field.
96,8786632,2,Great presentation.  Enthusiastic....make sure to fully explain theory and answer the specific questions.  Excellent poster!!
97,8786634,0,Excellent topic. Much needed research. Wish the study had been completed before presentation.
98,8786635,0,Research in progress due to hurricane and not able to visit the DR so the data was incomplete. It’s a good project and should have more info once they are able to collect the remaining data.
99,8786635,1,Excellent
100,8786635,2,Good job!
101,8786636,0,Great job
102,8786636,1,Presenter gave a good overview of the project. Data was still being analyzed as of yesterday so an additional paper was attached as results and there was no change due to the analysis not being complete.
103,8786637,0,"Great presentation of information. Personal connection to topic definitely draws people into discussion. Any non-medicinal options for treatments? Maybe ""create an end-product"" that would be something to share with others -
something creative to provide a useful process for others with epilepsy to consider going through before jumping into a treatment option. You should definitely look to publish something or even create a website or something interactive to share this info with the world. Great job speaking."
104,8786637,1,Loved the personal connection.
105,8786638,0,Excellent research idea.
106,8786638,1,Good presentation. The poster was a little blurry and had a hand written paper attached. That could have been better organized using printed material. It was hard to read. Very timely project and further research will be beneficial!
107,8786638,2,"Abstract needed to be more succinct. Poster contained minimal errors and layout supported presentation. Presenter was clearly knowledgeable, but rushed a bit."
108,8786638,3,Would like the scored paper example to be fully incorporated instead of taped on.
109,8786640,0,Good start research on parent advocacy training program to identify the need of minority population. Very informative and the research could have a direct impact on local community. Good job!
110,8786640,1,Work in progress. Presenter plans to follow up on study at different levels to increase awareness of parent advocacy for special ed students. She wants to provide information in other languages and increase advocacy across multiple grade levels and even into the university level. This research will provide good information for the families of special ed students.
111,8786641,0,Good job
112,8786641,1,Don't be so nervous! You are obviously passionate about this topic. Just have a conversation about what you learned! Poster had a lot of writing. Maybe incorporate something showing examples of implementing the methods you feel were best supported by research. Use some pictures related to the topic to draw the eye to your poster. Good information just get creative with presentation and be confident!
113,8786642,0,Great research topic and presenter demonstrated passion in this field. This research topic has great potential.
114,8786642,1,Enthused and a good literature review.
115,8786642,2,Very detailed study. Has many plans for further research and is implementing the activities at her campus. Has incorporated studies from around the world and plans to look at the study globally after a Texas data pull.
116,8786647,0,Awesome research
117,8786647,1,Great presentation. The project was relatable and further research in the field will be conducted. Visits to the Dominican Republic are planned to teach children who are deprived of education because they are from Haiti and have no “nationality”. Many children in the DR benefited from this research project and will continue to do so during future projects.
118,8786648,0,Work in progress so there is a lot of questions. The poster organization could use some work to make it more visually appealing. Presenter welcomed feedback and questions. There was very little information given due to the fact it has not been started yet.
119,8786648,1,"Abstract focused on future research, as did oral presentation. Clear passion for the subject, but not well-formed project yet (student spoke for only a couple of minutes). Do not know why poster was decorated with stars...not scholarly in appearance. Multiple errors on poster also detracted from the work. Would have been best to focus on research around definitions and teaching impact, then discuss future of project."
120,8786648,2,Great project to identify and define cultural competency. Great job!
121,8786648,3,Very good
122,8786649,0,"Could not correctly answer how the data in graphs answered the research question. Also, the abstract doesn’t completely correlate with the information presented."
123,8786649,1,"In the abstract, The background for doing the research doesn't seem to be connected with the purpose of the research. The poster has a nice visual presentation and the student did a great job explaining about her research."
124,8786649,2,"Very good, but research did not have a theoretical framework."
125,8786649,3,Very good oral presentation skill.
126,8786649,4,Interesting study about math as it relates to research and practice. Further research is being conducted. Presenter was very detailed with information and passionate about the research. Findings were reported well given the fact that there was a gap in reporting by school districts and journals. Further research will hopefully close the gap for students in the math area with any sort of disability or minority classifications.
127,8786651,0,Good presentation. Lots of research and data. Particularly interesting results due to Hurricane Harvey. Further research will be beneficial across multiple universities.
128,8786651,1,"Please follow the list of reasons by the data sets, it was confusing  to jump from one place on the poster to another. It might be helpful to disaggregate data by undergraduate and graduate; there was some disaggregated data presented on graduate students, not undergraduates though. Informative study."
129,8786651,2,Excellent research
130,8786651,3,Excellent presentation and research itself has great impact to the field. Great job!
131,8786654,0,This is a very timely research project. There are multiple questions that come with mentorship at the faculty level. Good presentation and detailed information when asked questions.
132,8786654,1,Excellent
133,8786654,2,"One reference, Creswell & Clark was missing full citation. Presenter was more focused on next phase of research than discussing current research."
134,8786654,3,"Interesting study and mixed method is a great method for this topic. Could focus on more specific group for future research, for example mentorship need of junior faculty. Good job!"
135,8786656,0,"There are no research questions presented in abstract, poster or presentation."
136,8786656,1,"Good presentation. When discussing project, you might start by explaining why you are doing the project or what drew you into this topic. A lot of writing on poster. Maybe condense and show comparison on xcel data side by side with your dashboard to emphasize the usefulness of what you are doing. Great product."
137,8786656,2,Very knowledgeable and the poster had great content.
138,8786656,3,Interesting information. Appears to be much easier than just using the “regular” reporting.
139,8786656,4,Great poster. He provided very detailed information about the application he hand wrote the code for. He was very professional and was able to answer all questions with additional information. The application is something which could be used by all universities should it become publicly available. Very good presentation!
140,8786658,0,"Abstract needed to be more succinct. Poster layout was good, but some areas were very small due to the amount of content shared. Oral presentation was good, but again, it is important to make the critical points clear...don’t lose the research in the conversation."
141,8786658,1,Great presentation!  Very well received and provided meaningful research for degree programs. Further research will be interesting.
142,8786658,2,Excellent research
143,8786658,3,Very nice job. Too much narrative on poster.
144,8786658,4,Great job presenting the research project! The research did a great job implementing the project into classroom teaching.
145,8786659,0,Poster did not present the research question nor did it included data to support the findings. Everything was based on researcher’s perceptions.
146,8786659,1,Research data was her experience
147,8786659,2,Research results were based on the personal experience.
148,8786659,3,This was a very interesting presentation as it related to a more practitioner based research project. Presenter was very knowledgeable and provided great information about her research. She was able to take the findings and utilize them in her own teaching as a student teacher. This project will enhance her ability for flexibility and adaptation in the classroom.
149,8786659,4,"Great job presenting her study on site!  Very interesting topic and she showed great potential in future research. Could further work on research methodology, for example, specify what specific method was used for better clarify."
150,8786659,5,Sydney you had excellent eye contact and were very poised when you presented. I can tell you are already a wonderful and vested teacher and children in your class will be lucky to have you. You might consider adding another picture to your poster to balance out the large white space at the bottom. Also be careful photographing children-you May need to add some kind of small print saying “pictures of children were used with parental consent”. Not sure about that so you might want to check. Best wishes on your future endeavors.
151,8786662,0,Zdenek Tronicek
152,8786662,1,"Poster is full of grammatical errors,  starting on the first line of the abstract. The main acronym, ICS is never explained, moreover, the presenter mistakenly thinks it means International Cybersecurity, although it's Industrial Cybersecurity.  Long rambling phrases without punctuation, e.g. the hypothesis is five lines without one comma. There was no research conducted, just a brief literature survey; the images are screenshot directly from the online studies cited. The presentation jumps from stating the hypothesis directly to the (unsupported ) conclusion."
153,8786662,2,The poster would be improved through a more though didussion of the results. This is a vital topic for present manufacturing.
154,8786662,3,"the presentation was excellent
the graphs could have been better explained"
155,8786664,0,Talk about future direction of work.
156,8786664,1,Show future work too or talk about direction of future experiments.
157,8786665,0,"good presentation
could use to draw the audience in more with applications"
158,8786665,1,Zdenek Tronicek
159,8786665,2,"This is solid, publishable work, thoroughly tested agains several other approaches! The algorithm is clearly better than the existing ones. Conclusion should quantity how much better the algorithm is in each category."
160,8786666,0,Take time to know everything your poster has on it and be able to explain it.
161,8786667,0,Showing figures of reduction of emissions  on a percent basis would improve poster quality.
162,8786667,1,Grammatical mistakes in abstract and poster
163,8786668,0,Investigate statistical significance of trends using a hypothesis test and pvalue. R2 value alone cannot assess statistical significance.
164,8786668,1,Very well spoken.  Knew her research.
165,8786669,0,Could be a bit louder and explain abstract more clearly.
166,8786671,0,Including numerical data that you obtained in your tests to derive the conclusions would make your presentation stronger. Keep up the good work. Best..
167,8786671,1,"The poster needs more details. How the ideas are reasoned in real time, in the  real roads situation on the highways and in the condensed traffic? This is the main problem. However it is a good endeavour."
168,8786671,2,Could be a bit louder when speaking.
169,8786671,3,Could speak a bit louder and make more clear the abstract.
170,8786672,0,Including references and numerical data showing the implementation of the code in your project would make your presentation stronger. Keep up the good work. Best..
171,8786672,1,I’m TSU Prof but not this college.
172,8786672,2,"No references,"
173,8786672,3,"Excellent presentation but I did not see an abstract,  even though you covered it well orally.  I appreciate the work you have done.  Great experience and effective slide organization. Might consider funding out what's insider the ""black box"" and more details about sensors that control the pendulum. Good collaborative work."
174,8786673,0,Including an abstracr and referencess would make your presentation stronger. Keep up the good work. Best..
175,8786673,1,Please include sources next time 😩!
176,8786673,2,Add refernces
177,8786674,0,Including more details in future directions of research would make your presentation stronger. Keep up the good work. Best..
178,8786674,1,needed more examples of direct applications
179,8786674,2,Very interesting and exciting project. It is great to see the skills you are acqiuring through this research experience. It might be helpful to be clear about how your work ties with your title. The swapping of the sress-strain curves were a simple oversight.  Good work.
180,8786675,0,Very interesting topic that can have many applications. Good job.
181,8786675,1,Speaker could be more enthusiastic about his presentation
182,8786676,0,Zdenek Tronicek
183,8786676,1,more information on the hardware that produced the images and possible applications would improve the presentation
184,8786676,2,"The actual genetic algorithm is not described! Great proof of concept, but we need a systematic way to judge the accuracy of the method, beyond eyeballing the two example images!"
185,8786677,0,too much on the math and not enough explanation of the applications
186,8786678,0,Zdenek Tronicek
187,8786678,1,"System validation needs more testing, with different pins."
188,8786678,2,"great knowledge of the content
very informative 
very original and interesting"
189,8786679,0,"There are no ideas for future work listed. The conclusion states that the algorithm will be effective with imperfect pips, but this is not supported by evidence."
190,8786681,0,Including numerical data comparing the control speed to air pressure models would make your presentation stronger. Keep up the good work. Best..
191,8786681,1,Not a finished project!
192,8786681,2,Lgorothm must be compared to at least one similar algorithm in terms of performance.  What is the BigOh?
193,8786681,3,"This is still a work in progress,  the parts not fully integrated.  Be clear about personal controbution, show snippets from your OWN code."
194,8786682,0,The poster needs good conclusions for the outcome of the research.
195,8786683,0,The student understands the concept of the topic very well.
196,8786683,1,Good comprehensive work
197,8786687,0,There is no poster displayed. No show
198,8786688,0,"The student should know the ablicability and objectives of her method, and how the simulation analysis give her the real results to create economic energy prospect."
199,8786688,1,I enjoyed your presentation.
200,8786689,0,"Could be a bit more creative with the formatting of the poster. Silica themed colors of text, rock shaped bullet points, etc."
201,8786689,1,The student should know what are the mixtures of soil types that can give him the best compaction results. Also he needs to understand that one sample is not sufficient to create the conclusions that he presented. The project is very interesting for his level as undergraduate student.
202,8786689,2,Good poster presentation
203,8786691,0,"The student understands the concept and the simulation modelling. However,  he  could not explain the applicability of the simulation in the real world of cleaning the hazardous materials that affect the envirnment."
204,8786691,1,Read more details about literature that your research was based on.
205,8786692,0,Great presentation! Only feedback is to talk a little bit louder when presenting.
206,8786696,0,Great communication skills
207,8786697,0,Including information about your fuzzy method and a comparison to existing methods would make your presentation stronger. An abstract and a references sections would be good. Keep up the good work. Best..
208,8786698,0,"Poster doesn't have abstract,  but only introduction. Student's personal contribution is not explicitly stated. Student was very knowledgeable."
209,8786698,1,Security of the data flow.
210,8786698,2,"great teaching concept

not clear on specific implementations"
211,8786698,3,Zdenek Tronicek
212,8786700,0,The student needs to understand the concept of her research. Needs to understand of the methodology.
213,8786701,0,"I thoroughly enjoyed your presentation, and it was clear that you are passionate about your work. It was not quite clear at the beginning that the work was based on simulations. I will look forward to hearing about your experimental results as well soon. Great presentation."
214,8786702,0,Worked very hard in a year to gain the understanding of a very complex system.
215,8786702,1,Excellent job of explaining your research! This is a really interesting and important study for that region.
216,8786702,2,"Ermon is an enthusiastic presenter who knows his project, his data, and the implications of his research. Impressive! Now he just needs to interview locals about their perceptions on hydrological change to complement his already excellent thesis."
217,8786703,0,In research one poses a hypothesis and then does an email valuation to prove or disprove the hypothesis.    The abstract would be better to approach with a question rather than saying should.  Work is in the early stages good luck in the results.
218,8786704,0,Very nice presentation. Confident and knowledgeable.
219,8786705,0,Excellent job! Good understanding of study background and great job of explaining methods and results

223,8786706,2,Having less text in the form of bullets would improve the quality of the presentation.
224,8786707,0,"Lack of results and discussion in abstract but since data was collected so recently this is understandable. Good use of color. Good font size, easy to read."
225,8786707,1,Data analysis will further improve the quality of the presentation.
226,8786708,0,It would have been good to include some preliminary results on the poster although I understand the statistics aren't complete yet. Maybe the best way to do this would have been to include some points about the obvious visual differences you saw between the suppression treatments and grazing/mowing treatments and then a brief discussion of why you think those things occurred. Good job with explanation of the methods and study background!
227,8786708,1,Project is in early stages so might have been useful to show results of pressure virus work that lead to current methodology.
228,8786709,0,They were amazing. Advisor should be very proud!
229,8786709,1,More details needed for posters. Orally plenty of detsils given. Not enough in conclusion.
230,8786710,0,Need more data analysis
231,8786710,1,Too much text. Would recommend more visuals.
232,8786711,0,No poster and no show.
233,8786712,0,Great project!
234,8786713,0,"Poster figures were very informative.  Consider reducing the amount of text.  That way the student can talk about the project and the font will be larger so it can be more easily read.  

Great project!"
235,8786713,1,Needed figure legends that indicate color coding as well as data source.  I understand it is preliminary :)
236,8786714,0,Good font size. Easy to read from far away. Excellent abstract and presentation!
237,8786716,0,The student understands the concept. Some of research methodologies should be revised specially when analyzed the diversity indices.
238,8786716,1,Good overall but need to explain what factors besides area influence biodiversity
239,8786767,0,It would be helpful to put a picture or something in the middle to attract attention and draw the reader to the poster. Great job in presenting orally! Clarissa has a passion for research!
240,8786767,1,"Mary Winton
Abstract missing findings.
Poster confusing on results - seems to be positive results rather than needs.

247,8786789,1,Good job explaining the technology
248,8786790,0,Fascinating research. It would be nice to present some clearer ideas about future directions.
249,8786791,0,Small font makes it difficult to see at 1.5 paces away. Busy background distracts from data/ study.
250,8786791,1,A great team! They were very enthusiastic and the project is very interesting!
251,8786792,0,Very well spoken. Was very well prepared and was able to concisely describe a complicated research plan.

253,8786792,2,Ver good organization and excellent presentation.
254,8786793,0,Presenter done a great job in explaining.
255,8786794,0,Fascinating research and good job with the joint presentation.
256,8786794,1,Including numerical data for the effect in healthy cells and delivery rates would make your presentation stronger. Shorter abstract and a references section would be good. Keep up the good work. Best..
257,8786794,2,poster could be improved by including hypothesis and statistical analysis.
258,8786797,0,No show
259,8786798,0,Great job! Very knowledgeable on the topic. Great poster organization.
260,8786798,1,Would have loved to have seen a picture of a dissected GI and honey stomach
261,8786802,0,Great data and well presented. The text was a little small on the poster but the work done was strong.
262,8786803,0,Great Work .Excellent Presentation .
263,8786803,1,Very good
264,8786803,2,"Fascinating!

Thank you for your passion for oncology!!"
265,8786804,0,Poster is busy and it is a challenge to digest as printed. Significance legend on figure 4 not shown. Very through oral presentation with organized logic in thoughts and presentation.
266,8786804,1,Mary winton
267,8786805,0,Very impressive research and great presentation. Please make sure not to block the view of the poster when you are presenting. Some of your graphics were a little small and blurry.
268,8786805,1,Good.
269,8786806,0,Nice job! Very pertinent topic if you take the findings and then use that to convince facilities for change. Use what you found to establish prevention tools or at least to show the need for support of the participants who become injured. Make your findings even more valuable by causing change with them. Presented well. Poster looked nice. Maybe include more about future direction.
270,8786806,1,Presentation was great. The presenter understood their project and could answer various questions. Did well in discussing the research in layman’s terms.
271,8786806,2,"Loved the graphic representation on the poster.  Presenter has fantastic enthusiasm and personality.  

Would have liked to have seen/heard more about the implications of what is a VERY interesting study with important, yet predictable, findings. Study suggests that YBT be administered to the moderate to high risk population, but the YBT is the tool for establishing such risk categories...???  These points should be considered “minor”. Great job by Fritzi!!!"
272,8786807,0,It helps to spell out the hierarchical evidence-- what it is instead of using a code like 2c. It may be helpful to reorganize the poster so that there's a picture or something in the middle that draws the the person to the poster. Great job in presenting the material! Chelsey has a great passion for research!
273,8786807,1,"Presenter done an outstanding job in presenting. Howevr, poster is mainly a literature review study."
274,8786807,2,Mary Winton
275,8786808,0,No Show
276,8786809,0,Great job!
277,8786809,1,Only deduction for an absence of a graphic representation.  I think most people are visual learners and graphics could help communicate the quantitative significance of this VERY INTERESTING study of a VERY IMPORTANT problem.  The demeanor of the presenter was engaging and pleasant.  I had a lot of fun learning about the study and it’s implications.
278,8786809,2,"Mary Winton

Poster graphics with computer glitches which detracted from the overall look"
279,8786810,0,I thought the poster was well designed.
280,8786810,1,On the poster I might suggest to enlarge a picture and put it in the middle to draw the viewer to the poster. And somehow balance it out with the table of the literature which is also very helpful. Amelia absolutely knows her study and did a great job!
281,8786810,2,Mary winton
282,8786812,0,"Aim, objective, thesis, question missing as is conclusion."
283,8786812,1,I was very impressed by the amount of work that you have accomplished independently at your career stage. Fascinating topic!
284,8786813,0,"Poster - too busy with too much small text, graphics, and too many colors. The multiple small boxes break up the flow; use fewer, larger boxes instead. Presentation - friendly and confident. Speak a little too fast. Add more detail to explanation of method; why look at clotting, why use saline? Very clear on importance of study, applications and future projects. Abstract - relevant study. Conclusion sentence is weak."
285,8786813,1,"She is very passionate about your work, and your knowledge shows!"
286,8786814,0,"Poster - nice large font and graphics, attractive coloration and layout. Use higher resolution images. Put lines around boxes. Presentation - good confidence and friendliness in speech, though speak a little slower and careful to define all acronyms. Good job answering questions. Abstract - clear purpose and extensions. Gets a little muddled around methods. Some minor grammatical errors."
287,8786814,1,Give more methodology verbally
288,8786814,2,The presenter was well spoken and confident. Poster was easy to read
289,8786815,0,"Poster - attractive colors, blocks help organize flow. Illustrative graphics. Make data table bigger. Use less text overall and focus on main bullet points in larger text. Presentation - confident and  enthusiastic. Speak slower. Shorten spiel of intro to get to meat of project sooner. Abstract - clear relevance and goals. Well written."
290,8786815,1,"Poster - attractive colors, blocks help with glow, graphics are illustrative. Too much text; aim for less text in larger font. Presentation - confident and enthusiastic. Speak a little too fast. Spiel is a little long, shorten the intro and focus on the meat of your project. Abstract - clear relevance, goals, and results. Well written."
291,8786815,2,Larger font size in table would be helpful. Great background and methodology explanations.
292,8786816,0,Good presentation.
293,8786817,0,Mary winton
294,8786817,1,Interesting research. I like the video! It would be good to learn more about the cellular/molecular mechanisms of the drug.
295,8786818,0,The abstract had a few typos and grammar issues. Good job of presenting the data!
296,8786818,1,Poster was different from submitted abstract. Results presented are preliminary data for a larger long term study. Mr. Lopez presented the information of the poster very well and answered questions confidently and in a way that was easy to understand.
297,8786819,0,Give more background/importance verbally
298,8786821,0,"Error on bar graphs missing. Number of hours of video not presented. Good don’t size generally, but axis on graphics are to small to be seen from 1.5 paces away."
299,8786822,0,Great job!
300,8786822,1,Interesting research. It would be nice to see some pictures of the mosquitoes.
301,8786823,0,"Good start, it will be interesting to see results."
302,8786823,1,Lighter font color with the figure with dark background would improve visualization. Data from additional microsats may result in detention of higher hybridization.
303,8786824,0,Good explanation
304,8786824,1,"Very impressive presentation.  
With with great confidence"
305,8786826,0,Reduce verbiage on poster. Make images larger. Entertain and attract reader to a simple story that avoids viewer fatigue.

310,8786829,0,"Preliminary stage of research, so not much information available.  But further developed stage of research could have high impact in the area."
311,8786829,1,Love the personal connection the researcher has with the material. Great job!
312,8786829,2,I was able to understand more about the poster from talking with the student. It would be helpful for the poster to stand alone with more information about the possible differences between public and private insurance. On the graphs it would be helpful to have the variable stated. The poster itself has a nice visual look and the student was extremely knowledgeable about his research.
313,8786831,0,Including an abstract in your poster and the mathematical model you are proposing would make your presentation stronger. Keep up the good work. Best..
314,8786831,1,Improve force equipment.

316,8786832,1,"I congratulate you on a clear,  enticing,  informational presentation. Poster was very well organized.  I enjoyed the interdisciplinarity of it. You should capitalise on this combination of skills in your project.  That will justify why you might not be a  expert on all aspects of it. Excellent presentation and use of scool colors in your poster.  :)"

326,8786839,0,"very unique research presentation
an explanation of possible applications would draw people in more"
327,8786839,1,"Project redefines the classical concept of finite dimensional vector space as a “code” without motivation or justification. Claims a cryptology application is possible with no discussion of the details or even a broad overview. Contains the condition C subset orth complement of C, which only holds when C={0}."
328,8786841,0,"Poster had no abstract,  just introduction.  Research was qualitative,  goal not clear. Reid was very knowledgeable and passionate about her work."
329,8786841,1,needs more specific content
