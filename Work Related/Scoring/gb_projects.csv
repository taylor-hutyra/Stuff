</strong><br>
 BACKGROUND: Clinical microbiology has reached a new technological frontier for the identification of pathogenic bacteria and yeasts. New technology using mass spectroscopy, known as Matrix-Assisted Laser Directed Ionization/Desorption Time-of-Flight or MALDI-TOF, has been approved by the FDA and is currently available from two manufacturers. MALDI-TOF relies upon the unique protein fingerprint of the organism rather than biochemical profiles.
<br>
<br>
 Early adopters of the MALDI-TOF technology have reported that the system provides significant improvement in the rapid delivery of results to physicians and have found the system can be seamlessly incorporated into existing laboratory workflow. Limitations have also been identified by investigators and algorithms are being developed to address known issues with the identification of specific bacterial genera. In addition, there are currently no established methods for antimicrobial susceptibility testing using MALDI-TOF.
<br>
<br>
 OBJECTIVE: The objective of this pilot study is to compare results obtained from patient isolates identified using MALDI-TOF with traditional biochemical methods using the MicroScan identification system.
<br>
<br>
RESULTS: Both identification systems were in agreement with regard to the identification of commonly isolated gram-positive cocci and members of the 
<i>Enterobactereaceae</i> group. Less commonly isolated gram-positive cocci and non-fermenting gram-negative rods were more likely to produce discordant results. The MALDI-TOF system was able to produce an identification for several fastidious organisms that MicroScan could not identify due to non-viability or non-inclusion in the MicroScan database.<br>
<br>
CONCLUSION/FUTURE DIRECTION: The MALDI-TOF system and the MicroScan system produce similar identifications for commonly isolated gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Further research is required to evaluate MALDI-TOF identifications with regard to established phenotypic and biochemical parameters.

The theme of independence has been rapidly spreading among diaspora and minorities across the world. Many of these movements are also unfortunately accompanied by hostility and violence that consequently disrupt societies and further divide nations. This becomes particularly true when a group begins to utilize tactics such as terrorism as a preferred negotiation method to gain reactive results from the government. The fundamental question for lawmakers is whether it is effective to give its diaspora or minorities a semi-autonomous region and whether that would actually lower the statistical chance of conflict, the dependence of terrorism as a means of bargaining power and the amount of rebel groups that are active within the country? To address this vital question, an extensive data analysis is performed on a robust set of systematic data reflecting years-worth of statistics collected by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START). Initially assuming that providing an autonomous territory would lower domestic conflict, the analysis of the data demonstrates otherwise. Through the investigation of three case samples - Nicaragua, the Philippines and Portugal, results show that giving unsatisfied diaspora and minorities semi-autonomy is proven ineffective as a reactionary method. Furthermore, the utilization of such ineffective methods by law makers, such as creating semi-autonomous states, not only function as a temporary remedy to a much larger problem but also segregate and localize unappeased groups within a society while simultaneously encouraging ethnic and cultural nationalism. These strategies, more often than not, also ultimately lead to costly scenarios such as an increased national tension, violence, diminished populations, lost land and the eventual strive for the full independence from the parent country. This research opens a new dimension on how the government should strategically respond to the potential needs and threats posed by an alienated groups.<br>",TBD

Creating a clapping game and song by ""using bits and pieces from all over the place"" is characteristic of the way children compose and play musical games all over the world (Bishop &amp;Burn, 2013; Campbell, 2010; Countryman, 2014; Harwood &amp; Marsh, 2012; K. Marsh, 2008; K.Marsh &amp; Yound, 2006). All children are intuitively musical within playground communities. The childhood music heritage deserves the attention of music educators as it embodies creative compositional strategies and abilities that can potentially alter pedagogy in constructive ways. However, there is relatively little research on what children's musical games, stories, rhymes, and lullabies exist in south Texas and how they can be used as resources for pedagogic purposes in classrooms.<br>
<br>
The purpose of the project was to review, interview, transcribe, and recreate educational music teaching materials relating to childhood music cultural heritage of under-documented communities in Kingsville and the surrounding area. During summer 2017, music researchers reviewed documentation, books, sheet music and stories in published materials and interviewed a total of 10 community members in Kingsville areas. Audio data were transcribed and documented using electronic keyboard, GarageBand, word process and finale music software. They performed and recorded the songs in English and Spanish.

<br>
 Feral hogs (<i>sus scrofa</i>) are not native to the Americas, pigs were brought to the United States by European explorers and settlers. In years to come, the Eurasian wild boar was introduced for the sole purpose of hunting. Domesticated swine often escaped farms or were intentionally released into the wild. Hogs are omnivorous and can sustain themselves on plant and animal sources. Because pigs are prolific, and seem to adapt well in many environments, those first few pigs have resulted in several million feral hogs across the United States today. <br>
<br>
 In today's society, wild hogs are hunted for food, or as a sport. However because of their large numbers and the challenges of managing their destructive nature in unwanted places, wild hogs have been labeled as being an invasive and a nuisance. They are destructive and can destroy ecosystems as well as crops and fencing. It is said that feral hogs are the cause of soil erosion, disruptive natural water flow, plant succession, mineral imbalances, and many others. <br>
<br>
 The objective of our study is to investigate different flavors that wild hogs prefer in order to use for potential baits as well as avoidants. In the study, six different flavors (beer, banana cream, vanilla, peanut butter, baking soda, and nutmeg) are used to identify if hogs have a preference between the flavors. Flavors are mixed with cottonseed meal, weight and offered to pigs every three days. Game cameras are located by feeders to count preference as defined by amount of time with nose in the trough. Refusals are also weighed and recorded as an indicator of preference. Identifying a component can help control the population by allowing the hunters to trap and or hunt. <br>",TBD

Cancerous cells are cells that continue to divide uncontrollably in the body forming growth that are tumors. Cancerous cells are malignant and they spread into or invade nearby cells. The research objective is to develop alternative to known cancer treatment options that will selectively destroy cancer cells without compromising normal cells. The research will look into the fabrication of cation deficient copper(I) chalcogenides as plasmonic material in photo-thermal therapy for the destruction of cancer cells. The process involves the loading of this material into folic acid conjugated to heparin, where folic acid will look for and associate with foliate receptor sites common in most cancerous ability to find cancer cells, attach to the cancer cells and ablate the cancer cells when exposed to near infra-red light. The cation deficient copper (I) chalcogenides nanorods involve the solvothermal using copper (I) and, 1-dodocathiol and tert-dodocane thiol as thiol agent with adequtes control of the nucleation and growth temperature. The cation deficient copper (I) sulfide nanorods has been characterized using UV-Visible spectrometer, the powder x-ray diffraction was consistent with JDPDS file for a cation deficient copper (I) but slightly differs for a pure copper (I) nanocrystal, and SEM confirmed the nano-sized structure.

</b> The purpose of this study was to identify and describe the preservice needs of Tarleton State University pre-professional agricultural educators (<i>n</i> = 44). Pre-professional agricultural educators were identified as those who were enrolled in the AGSD 4601 – Clinical Teaching class for the 2017 Spring or Fall semester. A list of 68 modified competencies was developed and sorted into the three categories associated with the Agricultural Education Three Circle Model. The Borich Needs Assessment Model was used to determine the perceived level of importance and ability of pre-professional agricultural educators. All preservice needs were analyzed and ranked using mean weighted discrepancy scores (MWDS). The top three preservice needs in pre-professional agricultural educators were: (a) develop a budget; (b) assist students participating in the agriscience fair; and (c) to understand and apply principles and methods of agriculture, food and natural resources (AFNR) power, structural, and mechanical systems and related technologies. In contrast, the three competencies in which pre-professional agricultural educators required the least amount of preservice were: (a) maintaining and ability to properly use garden; (b) maintaining visual aids and references; and (c) shop and laboratory safety observed at all times. Overall, pre-professional agricultural educators had the most self-efficacy regarding the Supervised Agricultural Experience Programs (work-based learning) according to the Agricultural Education Three Circle Model. In contrast, pre-professional agricultural educators had the most concern regarding the Student Leadership Organization (FFA). <br>

Founded on the basis of its ecological benefits, bison restoration is known to considerably influence prairie communities. In an environment that contrasts highly with the historic American plains however, one must question how bison restoration will affect dynamics of today's ecosystems. This study investigates how bison-influenced environmental factors affect nesting success of prairie songbirds in a restored grassland. My objectives were to (1) determine how vegetation structure differs with grazing pressure, (2) examine the impact of nest site vegetation structure and grazing pressure on nesting success, (3) investigate the prevalence of cowbird parasitism on prairie songbird nests, and (4) examine the relationship between nesting success relative to distance from bison activity. I conducted this study during the summer of 2017 at the 15,314-acre Caprock Canyons State Park located in the high plains of the Texas Panhandle. I conducted nest searches following a plot design in 10 randomly generated 100m² plots representing a mixed-grass prairie landcover type. To discover nests within each plot, I used behavioral cues (e.g. nest building, copulatory, auditory), flushing, and systematic searches. Once located, I monitored nest contents until nesting failure or fledging. I measured vegetation structure at and around nest sites immediately upon nest success or failure. I determined nest proximity to bison activity using daily data acquired from GPS collars fixed to four individuals in the bison herd. The information obtained from this study will help influence management decisions at Caprock Canyons State Park. <br>",TBD

Marmosets, small new world primates, have recently been developed as an aging model. A number of phenotypic tools have been translated from rodent, and human studies into a comprehensive testing system for the marmoset. However, a preclinical marker of many human diseases associated with aging decline is the inability to comprehend and recall time as a normal function of the biological clock. This deficit is often difficult to assess in animals. One possible method is to assess an animal's preparation for the end of the day and entry into a sleeping nestbox. Video was recorded for twenty male-female pair housed marmosets beginning two hours prior to lights out which occurred daily at 7pm. The video was scored using the program Observer, recording instantaneous entry and exit from the nestbox. Activities outside of the nestbox including feeding, drinking, and locomoting are also sampled instantaneously. Previous examination of the videos using a 3-minunte sampling scheme revealed that on average individuals spent more time within the nest box thirty minutes prior to lights out when compared to 2 hours prior (males: 30 min = 8.08+0.94; 120 min=4.08 +1.14; p=0.012; females: 30 min = 7.55+1.47; 120 min=3.25 +1.16; p=0.04). We believe this non-invasive behavioral assessment offers a new technique for evaluating the biological clock function in future studies. More thorough video analysis will allow us to determine whether the activity of one individual is influencing the partner's sleep pattern and how this affects the overall health of the animal. Following marmosets longitudinally will allow us to determine whether disrupted biological clock patterns are associated with mortality. <br>",TBD

Functional decline associated with aging is the primary risk factor associated with dementia and many neurodegenerative diseases. In recent years research has focused on defining and attempting to expand health span4 of humans by prolonging the portion of their lifespan which is free of chronic disease. One potential intervention for health span is the FDA approved drug rapamyacin that was discovered as a biological product of bacteria located on Easter Island1. It has shown to be an effective immunosuppressant in humans and successfully increases longevity in mice3. However, before beginning age-related testing in healthy human adults, marmosets (<i>Callithrix jacchus)</i>, serve as a valuable transitional step from mice to humans. Marmosets are small nonhuman primates that are easy to handle, don't carry zoonotic disease, and are relatively short lived (approximately 6-10 years). Marmosets at the Barshop Institute are dosed daily with oral rapamycin in a yogurt vehicle. One method of testing rapamycin's efficacy on health span measures is by creating tasks that test the cognitive ability associated with executive function. Executive function is associated with impulsivity, decision making and planning. The detoured reach task tests the marmosets' ability to reach for a marshmallow and successfully retrieve it from a 5 sided clear cube that is randomly shifted to move the opening. Currently nineteen marmosets are being tested with sessions that consist of 20 trials with a maximum of 30 seconds to complete each attempt. An animal that successfully completes 18 out of 20 trials in less than or equal to 6 seconds reaches criterion. We hypothesize that the marmosets receiving daily doses of rapamyacin will maintain executive cognitive function better than control animals. <br>",TBD

Both the material of a surface and the time which has passed since one has interacted with a material can prove to be detrimental to the success of developing and matching a fingerprint to the correct person. These limitations can be overcome through the use of nanoparticles that can better adhere to the surface of the fingerprint over a range of materials and depths. By utilizing a combination of the unique properties of nanoparticles, the unique properties of aerosols, and advanced imaging techniques, fingerprints can now be developed in a much more sophisticated method that will better serve the needs of law enforcement officers.

Compared to monolinguals, some bilinguals exhibit an enhanced brain response--the N2 event-related potential (ERP)—which is linked to a neuroprotective effect of bilingualism during aging and pathology. When participants are directed to name pictures in two languages, the N2 effect is seen as a voltage increase during trials in which the required language switches compared to those in which it remains the same as the previous trial. The N2 has also been observed during other conflict-inducing tasks that require inhibition of one response in order to perform another. It is essential to assess the N2 in bilinguals because it will provide insight regarding how language switching occurs in the bilingual brain. Understanding the mechanism underlying this effect is crucial to determining the link between bilingualism and neuroprotection. To test the mechanism, the N2 effect is being explored during language switching with differing probabilities of encountering a language switch (20%, 50%, and 80%). Participants will name pictures in Spanish or English to test two theories regarding this effect. According to the inhibitory control theory, an N2 effect should be observed for switch trials at every probability. This is because in each condition, one of language will be inhibited to switch into the other. In contrast, response conflict is affected by probability. If a language switch occurs frequently, switch trials will be predicted and incur less conflict; whereas, if the probability of the switch is low, switch trials will be less predictable thus incur more conflict. Therefore, if the N2 effect during language switching is modulated by response conflict, the N2 effect is expected to 'flip,' such that it is larger for switch trials when the probability of encountering a switch is low (20%) but is larger in non-switch trials when the probability of switching is high (80%).<br>",TBD

 Periodontal disease (PD) is a common disease in canines and it affects approximately 80% of domestic dogs. It is also highly preventable. The best-known method for preventing PD is daily brushing. However, many dog owners do not have the time or patience to thoroughly brush their dog's teeth daily, especially if they own more than one dog. The purpose of this study was to find an effective yet simple alternative method to brushing that would reduce plaque-causing bacteria which can lead to periodontal disease. This study involved the participation of 24 dogs that visited Canyon Road Animal Hospital. Saliva samples were obtained from each dog using Super•SAL™ saliva collection devices. Samples were first enriched in broth before inoculating them on agar plates. Paper disks containing one of four canine oral hygiene products, including Tropiclean Fresh Breath Plaque Remover Pet Water Additive, Nylabone® Advanced Oral Dog Care Natural Foaming Tartar Remover, Petzlife Oral Care Spray and a homemade canine oral rinse (0.9% NaCl), were placed on the agar. Following incubation, any zone of growth inhibition was quantified and a statistical analysis was performed. The results demonstrated that Tropiclean Fresh Breath Plaque Remover Pet Water Additive exhibited the greatest growth inhibition. Because the oral flora is unique in every individual dog based on their diet, age, and breed, each product had different results. The homemade oral rinse was the least effective in reducing bacterial growth on all samples. However, the water additive had the most consistent effect on inhibiting oral bacterial growth overall.<br>",TBD

<i>Maclura</i><i> </i><i>pomifera</i> (Osage orange) is a species native to central and northeastern Texas and it produces large fruit (mass of 0.5 to 1.0 kg) in abundance. Two isoflavones, osajin and pomiferin, can be isolated by extracting the dried fruit tissue with diethyl ether using a Soxhlett extractor. The residual solid (obtained by evaporation of the ether) is composed of pomiferin and osajin present in a 2 to 1 ratio, respectively. Due to their structural similarity, the complete separation of these two compounds has historically posed some challenge. Several high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) protocols for separation of osajin and pomiferin in small quantities have been published; however, most of these involve expensive reverse phase columns using polar solvents in which these compounds have limited solubility. Previously, silica has been reported for use in the normal phase chromatographic separation of osajin and pomiferin; however, this usually only provides a partial purification of osajin (less than 90% purity). Very pure fractions of osajin can be rapidly prepared by using alumina as the adsorbent with a mixture of hexane and ethyl acetate as the mobile phase. Osajin and pomiferin are very soluble in this mixture and pomiferin binds very tightly to alumina while osajin is readily eluted. This protocol has been adapted for small scale use with prepackaged cartridges (Waters Corp.) or with larger packed columns prepared in the laboratory. A single chromatographic separation using this protocol can provide gram quantities of osajin with a purity greater than 95%. The preparation of pure osajin, that is free of lead ion, is important for the testing the tumor cell inhibiting activities of this compound.

 Brooke H. Dubansky (et al.)</strong><br>
<br>
 Heterotopic ossification (HO) is a process whereby mature soft tissues (skin, muscle, tendons, etc.) are replaced by bony tissue. This process can occur with numerous human diseases and can be a side effect of some medical procedures and traumatic injury. Inherited forms of HO are rare but debilitating, with no consistently effective treatment options. Animal models that naturally produce mineralized deposits in their skin (i.e., osteoderms), such as crocodilians, have never been utilized for studying these pathologic mechanisms in human disease. In this study, alligator scales known to develop osteoderms were collected at multiple time points up to one year post-hatch. Bone formation in the dermis of these scales was documented using classical histological staining and antibody staining for mechanistic markers of endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition and ossification. The development of osteoderms in crocodilians resembles the histopathologic and mechanistic progression of the inherited HO disorders Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva and Progressive Osseous Heteroplasia. Development of osteoderms proceeds <i>via</i> intramembranous ossification with mesenchymal cells being derived from an endothelial cell precursor and eventually acquiring an osteoblast phenotype. Future studies comparing the genetic basis of the inherited human disorders and osteoderm development in crocodilians have the potential to answer a wide range of questions concerning other soft tissue mineralization pathologies, as well as provide insight into the evolutionary trend of dermal armor reduction in vertebrates.<br>",TBD

We also produce new methods for measuring fairness and 'compactness' of a proposed plan by evaluating travel time between points in a given district, and quantifying accessibility of district polling places.<br>",TBD

 This work presents a graphical computational tool for automatic segmentation of gray and white matter regions as anatomical features in brain MRI images. Changes in the size or volume of these regions can be correlated to changes in cerebral structure in patients with Alzheimer's, dementia, cognitive impairment, or other neurological disorders. Specifically, the thickness of the cortex plays an important role in determining the severity level of dementia or cognitive impairment. The work herein presents a method using the gray-to-white matter thickness ratio computed from the brain MRI slices of the patient as part of the development of a software platform based computational tool for aiding neurologists in assessing anatomical and functional changes in cerebral structure from brain MRI scans of neurological patients. This graphical user interface can be implemented as a software package that can be installed in the computational platforms in the neurology department or division of hospitals. In its current implementation and deployment, this GUI automatically loads the brain MRI or CT images, processes them with the above-mentioned algorithms, and displays the extracted gray and white matter regions in the brain CT or MRI images as masks, segmented regions, or boundaries.<br>

Abstract</strong><br>
<br>
 A substantial number of people struggle with anger regulation to the extent that this impairs interpersonal function. Difficulty with anger regulation can contribute to conflict and even violence, with the potential to harm both the individual and others. Anger is often triggered by perceived unfair treatment; however, not all individuals respond equally to such situations. Accurate measurement of anger and aggression in response to provocation is important to improve research on this emotion. Although other behavioral tasks have been developed these typically focus on performance in competitive games and may not adequately capture the interpersonal interactive aspect of response to provocation. In the present study, 21 undergraduates completed a series of questionnaires and were asked to write an essay about something personally important and valuable to them. After submission, they received harsh feedback from a fictitious participant, but were told that the other participant's grandparent just passed away. Participants were then asked to read and evaluate the fictional participant's essay, which centered around the importance of their grandmother. Performance on this task was compared to responses on validated self-report measures of emotional regulation, anger, and its expression. Given limited research on this negative emotion (compared to depression and anxiety), this study offers a useful tool to continue to advance the field of anger research. <br>",TBD

 This research project is a continuation of research conducted by Thomas, Griffin, and Onweni (2017) that monitored the reaction between Manganese Oxide (MnOx) and Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2) and the results can be added to the pool of scientific knowledge gathered from this new, quantitative method of wetland boundary delineation. Procedures were previously based on qualitative methods that were inaccurate due to the subjective nature of human perception. Three (3) soil samples were collected from 3 sites that represented the Wetland, the Wetland Boundary, and the Riparian buffer. Three (3) replicate samples were tested which represented a grand total of 27 samples. Tests were conducted on samples and the results from the data that was gathered were used to compare the aforementioned sites using descriptive statistical analyses. The statistical analyses were used to determine the level of MnOx reactivity that should theoretically be greatest at the Wetland Boundary. Results indicated that the Wetland Boundary site had an average reactivity level of 3.87 that was higher than the Riparian Buffer level of 3.64 and the Wetland level of 3.07. These results corresponded with the research hypothesis that the Wetland Boundary should have the highest MnOx reactivity level, because the greatest amount of manganese should be precipitated in the landscape position that is between the source pool (Wetland) in saturated periods and the flow through zone (Riparian Buffer) during seasonally wet periods.

 This study explores the connection between C. S. Lewis's definition of <i>eros</i> (or romantic love), as he explored it in <i>the Four Loves,</i> and the portrayal of love in the Japanese anime <i>Ouran High School Host Club</i>. Inspired by the investigations of Mpaki Molapo and Iris Ralph into the blending of Western and Eastern Culture in Japanese cinema, the presentation seeks to examine the similar understandings of love in both cultures through these two very different texts. The study's overall purpose is two fold. First, it seeks to establish that <i>the Four Loves</i> deepens a Western understanding of <i>Ouran</i>, though immense cultural and temporal chasms separate the two. Second, the study seeks to use this connection as a starting point for further investigations into the applicability of Lewis's theoretical ideas to other texts and the continuity of Western and Eastern portrayals of romantic love. To these ends, the analysis centers around the character of Hikaru and his development from a self-loving character to one capable of Agapa, or self-less love of another person, through his relationship with the female protagonist. The presentation relies on close readings of the primary texts, but also builds off of scholarship on both Japanese culture and Lewis. Specifically, the study makes use of Tania Darlington's understanding <i>Ouran</i>'s place in the Japanese teen culture, <em>Louis Markos's application of Lewis's thesis to other literary works, and John R. Scudder Jr and Anne H. Bishop's research into the history of Lewis's ideas. </em>Overall, the final analysis considers parallel between the texts and raises further questions about the relationship between East and West and their borrowing from each other in popular cultural. <br>",TBD

This study examined whether acute exercise, and the timing during which it occurs after learning, affects memory recall. We hypothesized that exercise would improve memory regardless of whether it was immediately after learning or immediately prior to memory recall.
<br>
<br>
 Twenty-five participants studied 40 Swahili-English word-pairs individually for 5 seconds each on a computer monitor. After completing a distractor task they were then tested for their memory of the word-pairs by speaking the English translation of the Swahili word when prompted. The number of correct responses was recorded and served as a baseline level of memory. This procedure was repeated once more after which participants were randomly assigned to a consolidation condition (20 minutes of exercise + 20 minutes working on a puzzle), a retrieval condition (20 minutes working on a puzzle + 20 minutes of exercise), or a control condition (40 minutes working on a puzzle). Immediately after the experimental manipulation the participants were tested, without a study phase, a third time for their memory of the English translations.
<br>
<br>
A multivariate ANOVA was performed. The independent variable was treatment, and the dependent variables were the difference in the number of correctly recalled words, and percent change from baseline between tests two and three. There was a statistically significant effect of treatment on memory (F4,40 = 2.80, p = .039) with pairwise comparisons revealing the control group having a significantly more negative change from baseline than the retrieval group (p=.05). Interestingly, the consolidation treatment demonstrated a negative change from baseline compared to the retrieval group (p=.06) but not the control group (p=.775). The results of this study suggest that acute exercise may help retrieve newly formed memories, but only when the exercise immediately precedes memory testing.

Through innovative measures, Earth's natural resources can be used in a much more sustainable manner. In order to combat energy resource shortages, mankind should combine intellectual and financial resources towards alternative energy advancement, specifically, geothermal energy. Prime focus for geothermal energy advancement in the United States of America (USA) should be allocated towards co-produced water since previous national co-produced water estimates are between 15 to 20 billion barrels (bbl;1 bbl = 42 U.S gallons). Oil companies are now capable of using co-produced water from oil and gas fields for electricity generation instead of disposing the water into the subsurface or discharging it into the environment. Oil and gas wells in the USA with depths equal to 5000 feet or more are surrounded by rocks which are capable of transferring thermal energy to co-produced water. This solution may encounter temperatures exceeding 176°F (80°C) upon heat transfer. Scenarios such as this would be highly conducive for electricity generation within the state of Texas once the correct mechanisms are instituted and developed. There are various active oil and gas formations in Texas, but Eagle Ford Shale (EFS) stands out because it is the biggest tight oil reservoir in the USA and is ranked the second most productive gas producer. Based on two main factors: water temperature and water production, EFS has the potential to generate a significant amount of electricity.

Access to and the availability of reliable water sources are central for human and environmental health. In south Texas, the Nueces River Basin directly or indirectly plays that important role for many counties that use the watershed. Several segments of the Nueces River Basin are designated as ecologically significant as they serve crucial hydrologic, ecologic, and biologic functions. The hydrologically significant streams are of particular interest because they recharge the Edwards Aquifer, an essential water source for the region's agricultural, industrial, and residential activities. Unfortunately, the semiarid to arid south Texas climate leads to large inter-annual precipitation variability which impact streamflow reliability, and by extension, the aquifer's recharge. To further compound the issue, recent and current climatic shifts show increasing warming trends. The increases could severely affect the region's already vulnerable water sources causing concerns for water management as well as its aquatic communities. Consequently, our project aims to evaluate the Nueces River Basin's hydro-climatic trends from 1970 to 2014 and their impact on the watershed's ecologically significant streams. Rainfall and streamflow data were compiled from the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) and Hydro-climatic Data Network (HCDN) respectively, and they have been evaluated for statistical trends using various hydrologic indicators. So far, the study consistently shows decreasing trends for certain low-flow indicators in the central to eastern streamflow gauges over various temporal scales. The anticipated impacts of this project may aid resource planners and decision makers develop the necessary tools to manage water resources in the Nueces Basin region, particularly given their significance for both domestic consumption and ecological health. <br>

The North American porcupine (<i>Erethizon dorsatum</i>) does not exhibit external sexual traits aside from observed pregnancy and breeding behavior, making sex determination by visual inspection difficult. Physical examination by abdominal palpitation often requires chemical immobilization. Sequencing of sex-linked zinc finger (ZF) protein genes has been used for gender determination in the prehensile-tailed porcupine (<i>Coendou prehensilis</i>) and has been successfully applied to Erethizon (n=3). ZF protein genes are present in both X and Y chromosomes. Gender is determined by presence of heterozygous sequence (Zfx and Zfy) for males or homozygous sequence (Zfx only) for females. The Zfx and Zfy fragments differ at 16 base substitutions within the sequenced fragment. Objectives of this study were to confirm applicability of this molecular method in a population of Erethizon and to observe the male/female presence of Erethizon in 3 ecoregions of western Texas. <br>
<br>
 Tissue was collected from live and roadkill specimens. DNA was extracted using the DNeasy® Blood &amp; Tissue Kit. Initial PCR amplicons were sequenced by the University of Arizona Genetics Core Lab using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit and the ABI 3730XL DNA Analyzer. Chromatograms were aligned and analyzed using the program SEQUENCHER 5.4.6. Ninety individuals were sequenced and base pair profiles were used to determine gender; 49 male and 41 female. More males and fewer females than expected were observed across the 3 ecoregions in western Texas. <br>
<br>
 All anatomically confirmed samples were correctly assigned to known gender based on the generated sequence data, suggesting that this method provides an accurate technique to determine gender of Erethizon <i>ex situ</i>. Preceding microsatellite analysis of this sample set suggests 1 large population across ecoregions instead of the predicted 3, which may explain the unexpected male presence. Continued sampling throughout the 3 ecoregions, throughout the year, is recommended to better examine this observation. <br>",TBD

</strong>According to the U.S. Census Bureau (2017) Latinos account for 58.6 million of the population in the United States. However, despite being the second-largest racial ethnic group within the U.S. studies amongst Latino populations and the LGBT community have been scarce (Herek &amp; Gonzalez-Rivera, 2006). In particular, research regarding Latino attitudes towards homosexuals is limited. Despite the growth of LGBT civil rights in previous years, studies have shown that amongst Latino populations negative attitudes are still abound (Bornstein &amp; Bench, 2015; Herek &amp; Gonzalez-Rivera, 2006) Research has shown that negative attitudes towards homosexuals amongst Latino populations is associated with cultural factors such as machismo, marianismo, acculturation, and ethnic identity as well as religious involvement (Diaz, Ayala, Bein, Henne &amp; Marin 2001; Herek &amp; Gonzalez-Rivera, 2006; Harris, 2009) The current study hypothesizes that acculturation will be a significant positive predictor of attitudes towards lesbians and gays, and for machismo/caballerismo, marianismo, ethnic identity and religious involvement to be significant negative predictors of negative attitudes towards lesbians and gays. Preliminary results indicate that acculturation is a positive predictor whereas caballerismo and ethnic identity are  negative predictors of attitudes towards lesbians and gays. Considerations of these results should be taken into account by counselors to increase their awareness of factors affecting lesbians and gays within Latino populations. <br>

 Business process analysis is critical to an organization's efforts to improve its internal functions. In order to engage in meaningful and effective organizational change, in-depth understanding of organizational practices is essential (Biazzo, 2002). There are many tools and methodologies employed to undertake business process analysis by the organization. Business process modeling (BPM) is a diverse field with many potential options that may be beneficial depending on the goals of the organization and the nature of the processes being mapped (Vergidis, 2008). This presentation can be characterized as a case study of Texas A&amp;M University-Commerce Department of Institutional Effectiveness and Research's (IER) efforts to utilize business process mapping techniques to document how specific critical institutional processes are functioning and identify areas of improvement or automation. The IER department employed a basic process modeling technique, flow charts using Microsoft Visio, to map out several processes such as tenure faculty reviews, state reporting procedures, and new faculty hiring. The use of flow charts was selected as the method of modeling due to its excellence in providing an overview of processes' general operations, its inexpensive nature, and its simplicity to create, and educate viewers (Jones, 1986; Giaglis, 2001). The use of flow charts and identifying opportunities for automation will allow institutions to more effectively allocate their resources to better serve students during a time when budget cuts are a more frequent occurrence.<br>",TBD

<i>Crotalus oreganus helleri</i> (Southern Pacific Rattlesnake) is responsible for the majority of severe envenomations in southern California. Bites cause local tissue damage including prominent edema or/and hematological abnormalities. The main components of <i>C. o. helleri</i> venom are enzymatic enzymes including metalloproteinases and phospholipases A2s, which play a major role in the pathogenesis of local tissue damage. On the other hand, non-enzymatic proteins (such as disintegrins, C-type lectins, cysteine-rich secretory proteins, and myotoxins) also play a role in the envenoming. C-type lectins are commonly found in low amounts in most snake venoms. They bind to plasma proteins, specific receptors on platelets, vascular or lymphatic endothelial cells and interfere in the prey's physiological processes. C-type lectins are also considered promising molecules for research tools and treatment of certain diseases. The goal of this project is to isolate C-type lectins from <i>C. o. helleri</i> venom to determine their biological activities. We have isolated C-type lectins using reversed-phase chromatography. Fractions 37, 38, 40, and 43 contained C-type lectins with molecular weights about 26 kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE and N-terminal sequencing. They will be further purified using cation exchange chromatography. Purified C-type lectins will be tested for cellular functions on human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells (HDLECs). Studies of these C-type lectins not only facilitated a better understanding of the snakebite pathology but also lead to the development of therapeutic agents.

 The incidence rates of colon and liver cancer differ dramatically in the Northern and Southern India. It has been suggested that diet plays an important role in their occurrence. The consumption rates of curcumin and EGCG in these regions are diverse as well. The compounds chosen for this study are curcumin, an active agent of turmeric and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), an active compound of green tea. Numerous studies have demonstrated the multi targeted and beneficial effects of curcumin and EGCG in role as a chemopreventive agent. One drawback with using these natural compounds is they must be administered in high quantities to be effective. This problem can be overcome by using combination of these compounds, which has been proven effective even when administered at lower concentrations. This study seeks to demonstrate the individual and combined effects of two natural compounds on liver and colon cancer cell lines. Preliminary study on the cell viability suggests that at high doses of EGCG, the cell viability of ARPE-1, HEPG2 and colon cancer cells were significantly reduced compared with high doses of curcumin. However, when various combination of the two drugs at high concentration were used, there was an initial decrease in cell viability in the ARPE-1 cells which recovered after prolonged exposure, but normally functioning cells have the ability to recover quickly, avoiding cell death. Interestingly, combinations involving equal concentration of the drugs had the most effect on the cell viability at longer exposure on both ARPE-1 and HEPG2 cell lines. The effects of combination of drugs are yet to be tested in the colon cancer cell line. The preliminary results will be confirmed on a time-dosage dependent pattern by monitoring the cell proliferation and cell death. Expression of apoptotic genes will be studied at the gene and protein levels.<br>",TBD

 Tenderness and consistency are continuing challenges in beef products. Calpastatin (CAST) is a protein that inhibits muscle degradation and post-mortem tenderization of meat. At the mRNA level, at least four specific <i>CAST</i> variants have been reported in cattle, but most quantification methods do not differentiate between the specific isoforms. This project measured three unique isoforms of <i>CAST</i> and correlated these isoforms to shear force tenderness in beef cattle. Fresh cheek muscle samples were collected on thirty commercial cattle immediately after harvest for relative gene expression analysis on <i>CAST I, CAST II</i>, and <i>CAST IV</i> isoforms by qPCR. Ribeye steaks were retained from each carcass, aged, cooked, and analyzed for shear force to measure tenderness. The qPCR data for each <i>CAST</i> isoform were then regressed on shear force for each animal. <i>CAST I </i>showed significant correlation to tenderness (p= 0.0036), while <i>CAST II</i> (p= 0.1771) and <i>CAST IV </i>(p= 0.6289) were not significant. These data suggest <i>CAST I</i> specifically has an effect on tenderness, and that <i>CAST I</i> expression in a less valuable cheek meat can be used as a predictor of valuable rib cuts. A future direction for this project includes developing a quick, non-invasive assay to predict tenderness and total value of a beef carcass, allowing the industry to improve consistency and profitability. <br>

A recent study has shown that veterans are 15 percent more likely to encounter food insecurities compared to civilians (Grossfield, 2015). With the assistance of Meals on Wheels, a nationwide agency that provides nutritional assistance, researchers surveyed 75 participants using a convenience sampling method. The survey tool used is a mixed methodological study with an emphasis on qualitative data. The most basic need for humans includes physiological fulfillment in order to grow physically, emotionally, and psychologically (Maslow, 1954). A veteran must satisfy the need for food in order to be motivated to advance ones wellbeing. In order for veterans to maintain being productive members of society food insecurities must be satisfied before higher levels of growth can be addressed. The researcher's hypotheses focuses on the age of veterans with food insecurities, and their comfortability and knowledge involving food assistance programs. The results of this study will reveal the percentages of the veteran population who are affected by food insecurity. The study educates the applicable agencies on the severity of this issue. Increasing knowledge of the issue of veteran food insecurity improves the dignity and worth of each person by promoting access to resources to satisfy their basic needs.<br>",TBD

 Reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) is an immunosuppressive avian retrovirus. REV can infect B-cells, a component of blood, and has been identified in wild galliform birds, such as turkeys. The virus also infects endangered Attwater's prairie chickens (APC) and has been an obstacle in conservation efforts. Infected individuals may exhibit symptoms such as anemia and neoplasia. There is evidence that blood-feeding insects may act as mechanical vectors. The mode of transmission and prevalence in nature is little known. We hypothesize that a population of wild turkeys in Texas are infected with REV and are a reservoir for transmission by insects to other closely related birds, such as APCs. By understanding the sources of new infections, additional measures could be implemented to protect at-risk populations. Our aims include determining the prevalence rate of REV infection in wild turkeys in Texas, isolating and propagating virus from recently infected APCs, and determining whether there is genomic variation of the virus. Blood samples from 331 wild Rio Grande turkeys from 18 counties were collected between January 2016 and April 2017. DNA was extracted and viral DNA amplified by polymerase chain reaction using REV-specific primers. REV was detected in six counties, primarily in central Texas, at prevalence rates of 5% – 10%. Further, we tested 88 imported Eastern wild turkeys from three states and detected REV in one individual from West Virginia. Blood from 31 infected APCs was collected between December 2015 and July 2017, and B-cells were isolated from one sample by Ficoll gradient. Isolated cells were co-cultured with chicken DF-1 cells to propagate the virus. Virus titers were determined by immunofluorescence assays at 6.8×105 50% tissue culture infectious dose, demonstrating successful isolation and propagation of REV. Initial next generation sequencing of the virus resulted in 77% coverage of the whole genome. Sequence alignment analysis showed a highly conserved genome, however a short region was variable as compared to sequences from 2001. This variable region may identify sources of new infections. Future experiments will determine whether REV can be detected in quail, whether mosquitoes can harbor the virus, and develop novel diagnostic methods for field-collected blood samples.<br>",TBD

 Education is a complex subject that many undergraduate students take on. While courses can provide a variety of resources and practices, many of these undergraduate students do not fully understand the essentials to teaching until experiencing it first-hand. This first-hand experience, or student teaching, is divided up into two semesters: Block 1 and Block 2. During Block 1, the “student teacher” experiences one school day each week for 12 weeks. During Block 2, the “student teacher” experiences full-time teaching for 72 days. During this process a student teacher has the opportunity to learn and grow as a future teacher. Daily, student teachers observe and experience the daily challenges, benefits, and opportunities teaching has to offer. Not only does the teacher develop his/her own teaching capabilities, but also the skills to collaborate, analyze, assist, guide, etc. Within this presentation, the experiences and conclusions formed from each student-teaching semester will be compared. Reflections, revelations, and turning points will be taken note of. As this experience pushes on through the days, more and more knowledge and skills are shared and practiced with the student teacher. <br>",TBD

Domestic Minor Sex Trafficking are children born in the United States that have been coerced into a life of pornography, stripping, and sexual services in America. It is estimated that there are approximately 100,000 children that are involved in domestic minor sex trafficking in the United States. Extensive research has been focused on girls that are lured into this life of delinquent activity and they are often defined as the <i>victim</i> of sexual exploitation. In contrast boys are not defined as <i>victims</i>, but as male sex workers. There are little to no services available for boys of domestic minor sex trafficking. The purpose of this paper is to bring awareness to the problem that boys are not just male sex workers, but are victims of sexual exploitation and are in need of services that are now being afforded to girls who are similarly situated. The research question is: Do College students have a positive perception about helping domestic sex trafficked boys?<br>",TBD

 Recently cholesterol has been putatively identified as a molecule that contributes to dementia. Deranged lipid metabolism has been implicated in neurocognitive disorders including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Cholesterol lowering medications, including statins, naturally are receiving a lot of attention for the possibility that they may be able to moderate the cognitive deficits associated with dementia related disorders. Although this is an intriguing possibility, there is much dissention in the literature concerning the actual effect of cholesterol lowering medications on cognitive functions. Moreover, the mechanisms by which these medications might achieve their effect remains unclear. In this experiment we attempt to determine if estrogen exerts an effect on synaptogenesis in a brain neuron cell line, and we also attempt to identify a mechanism by which estrogen might exert its effect. We used a commercial hippocampal cell line (H19-7) and western blotting techniques to investigate these questions. Our results indicate that while a statin drug (Pitavastatin) moderates the formation of estrogen in our hippocampal cell line, its effect on synaptogenesis remains unclear. Moreover, we could find no evidence that two important receptors for estrogen in our cells are involved in limiting synaptogenesis in H19-7 cells. Our future endeavors will include verifying earlier data from our lab that indicated that statin treatment does limit synaptogenesis in H19-7 cells. <br>",TBD

The purpose of this research was to examine the effect of student's involvement with community volunteering, group organizations, and or activities on bystander intervention. Participants completed a Cultural Orientation Scale, Sense of Belonging scale, and a demographic survey. Regression analysis was conducted to determine which factors correlated with whether bystanders helped a confederate pick up dropped books. There was not a significant relationship between helping behavior and campus involvement. Results were that students who had a strong sense of belonging and feeling that they were part of the campus would help more.

 Mounting evidence indicates that Earth is currently losing biodiversity at a rate that is many times greater than the background extinction rate of the past 540-million years. While habitat destruction and invasive species are viewed as the two main drivers of The 6th Extinction, anthropogenic climate change is also a contributor. Amongst other things, climate change can alter the geographic ranges of species in ways that reshuffle the compositions and spatiotemporal dynamics of ecological communities. One potential consequence of such reshuffling is increased hybridization between closely related species that were once reproductively separated from one another. Such interspecific hybridization is recognized as a potential driver of extinction because it can lead to the production of less fit hybrids or the replacement of one or both of the original species with hybrids. The Southern Appalachian Mountains are home to several species of lungless salamander that have some of the smallest geographic distributions of all mainland North American vertebrates. One of these species, the Peaks of Otter Salamander (<i>Plethodon hubrichti</i>) is restricted to a ~ 19 km stretch of ridge in west-central Virginia. The entire area occupied by <i>P. hubrichti</i> is surrounded by the morphologically and ecologically similar Red-backed salamander (<i>P. cinereus</i>)—a very abundant species with a wide geographic range. While hybridization among closely related plethodontid species is well known, it is currently unclear whether <i>P. hubrichti</i> and <i>P. cinereus</i> are hybridizing. To assess this possibility, we used microsatellite markers to investigate whether there is evidence for admixture between <i>P. hubrichti</i> and <i>P. cinereus</i>. In our poster, we present the preliminary results of this study.<br>

Many Spanish speaking individuals come into the United States with little to no knowledge on how to speak the native language (English). Due to this language barrier it becomes difficult for individuals to achieve certain goals such as continuing their education or building a career. The purpose of this research was to examine the impact that literacy interventions had in the Spanish speaking population in the United States. Participants' attitudes toward education were verbally assessed using a Spanish survey. We used a pre-test/post-test design to evaluate changes in attitude as a result of the intervention. With better literacy skills we are giving individuals the opportunity and the confidence to do better for themselves. We hoped to serve as role models to individuals with a second language barrier by demonstrating to them that it is possible to learn a different language and be successful. One potential benefit of a short-term literacy intervention is to change attitudes regarding education so that participants will seek out future literacy education. Knowing if this effect is attained will help educators to harness short-term literacy interventions to encourage long-term pursuit of education.

ABSTRACT<br>
<br>
Converting bermudagrass pastures into native species prairies with high diversity is a multi-stage process. Factors include cost, timing, seed and equipment availability, climate, soils and management limit success. Bermudagrass has many adaptations that resist suppression: fast growing, dense and resilient. These agronomically desirable traits create problems when converting pastures to diverse grasslands dominated by native plants. Because bermudagrass is so aggressive it easily out-competes native species, especially during the first few years when native seedlings are most vulnerable. Common range control practices, such as prescribed burning, are mostly futile, because they are usually used while bermudagrass is dormant. <br>
<br>
This project compared seedbed preparation and native seed mixes to determine which are most effective at converting bermudagrass monocultures into diverse native grasslands that mimic prairies once widely present in Texas. The three seedbed preparation methods were no-till and drill, disc and drill and disc, broadcast and roll. <br>
<br>
No-till drills have been increasing in popularity in recent years with the growing problem of erosion, but this method could present a problem with weed suppression. On the other hand, disking can cause flushes of quick-growing weeds that suppress native seedlings. Drilling places seeds directly into the ground, ensuring seed-soil contact, but can also bury the seed too deep where it cannot emerge. Broadcasting allows for more dispersed seeding, but cannot always guarantee proper seed-soil contact. <br>
<br>
Our trial took place in two locations following five bermudagrass suppression approaches. We measured seedling emersion and ground cover 2 and 4 months following planting. <br>
<br>
Objective: increase biodiversity through native species in monoculture pastures, increase soil health which will supply habitat and food sources to native wildlife, especially ground-dwelling birds such as bobwhite quail.<br>

 Irrigation scheduling is the process of determining the correct frequency and duration of irrigation (when to irrigate and for how long to irrigate?) in agricultural crops and urban landscape. Advances in real-time computing helped scientists to develop user-friendly irrigation scheduling tools which calculate near real-time plant water requirements based on near real-time site specific rainfall, reference evapotranspiration (ETo), soil and plant growth data. The main objective of this study is to develop a new irrigation scheduling tool to provide site-specific near real-time irrigation scheduling data for agricultural crops and urban landscape in Texas. The web-based irrigation scheduling tool allows the user to add new fields and select different crops, soils, weather stations and planting dates. The user can modify crop and soil related default parameters according to the location of the selected field. The user can also extract soil data of the selected field based on Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO). The tool keeps track of the status of the different soil water budget components (crop ET, soil water content, water loss due to deep percolation and runoff) on a daily basis using user selected inputs (including irrigation amount) and near real-time weather data. The tabular and graphical outputs of the tool show temporal variation of soil water content in the selected field. Based on this information and specification of the irrigation system, the user can decide when to irrigate and for how long to irrigate. This new tool will help in increasing irrigation water use efficiency in agricultural crops and urban landscape in Texas, eliminating over and under irrigation. In our future work, we will incorporate forecasted weather data in the tool which will provide information on the potential change in soil water content of the selected field in the next 5 to 7 days.<br>",TBD

Counselors are in a prime position to address the mental health needs of the medical community, and as a result could help increase patient safety. There is a high rate of depression among physicians and medical students. Untreated depression can be harmful to both the physicians and their patients. Patient death or serious harm due to medical errors by impaired physicians could be reduced through effective mental health treatment. Occupational stress and extremely demanding work expectations can contribute to the high rate of suicide among physicians and medical students. Additional challenges are faced by sexual minority and female medical professionals due to societal pressures. The same mental health impairments faced by physicians may be prevalent within other segments of the medical community, such as nurses, nursing students, lab technicians. Further research will explore the impact of depression and other mental health issues among members of these groups.<br>",TBD

 A team of electrical engineering students has designed an autonomous robot to follow a given path and perform predetermined tasks. The required tasks include reading a standard six-sided randomly-positioned die face in a cup, detecting the number of pips on the die face, and then displaying that number. We have implemented a computer vision system in the robot. Object detection has been accomplished for circular objects using Hough transforms before; however, the Hough transform has limitations. The implemented vision solution utilizes blob analysis, a much more robust and flexible tool. An image of the die is captured and processed using the Raspberry Pi Zero and Camera v2 module and the OpenCV library. Image preprocessing techniques, including noise removal and contrast enhancement, are applied to the image before performing blob analysis. Blob analysis is then achieved using binary thresholding, circularity and inertia ratio, chosen to tailor this implementation more closely to the task of die pip detection. The resulting images show only the pips of the die with some shadows. Red circles are automatically drawn to highlight the pips and shadows are excluded. The program correctly identifies only the pips of the die and returns the number as an integer.<br>",TBD

 The Lower Cretaceous Bluff Dale Sand underlies the Glen Rose Formation, and is the uppermost member of the Twin Mountain Formation in Bluff Dale, Texas. The Bluff Dale Sand is exposed at the base of the hillsides in the surrounding area. The sand has previously been interpreted as equivalent to the Hensel Sand member of the Twin mountain formation, which is found exposed 165 miles to the south as part of the Kerr basin, with no intermediary exposures. The Kerr Basin is one of the most underexplored basins in Texas, and information about regional geology is limited. To the north, the Bluff Dale sand is part of the flanks of the Fort Worth Basin. These two basins are separated by the Llano uplift, and lacking evidence indicating their equivalence, the Bluff Dale Sand is interpreted as a separate member. In the field, this outcrop presents numerous coarsening upward units, varying from muds to fine quartz sands. Included in this outcrop are two distinctly resistant units of barite cemented sands, as well as fragments of bivalves, vertebrate parts, calcite veins, and iron concretions. Sedimentary structures, such as ripples, laminated beds, and associated fossils support the interpretation of this unit as a transitional shoreline-to-lagoon environment. Barite cement formation is interpreted as having occurred as diagenetic cementation, likely due to the combination of basin subsidence, sea level rise, and probable faulting in the area. <br>",TBD

 Studio physics, or SCALE-UP, has been found to improve outcomes such as conceptual understanding, problem-solving skills, and student attitudes when compared to traditional instruction. Such an active-learning environment relies heavily on group work. However, little is known about how best to structure groups and train students to work together effectively. In order to understand the factors that affect group productivity, we recorded videos of groups in the introductory calculus-based physics sequence at Texas A&amp;M University-Commerce over three semesters. Videos were recorded of students working tutorials. Video data have been coded for epistemological framing and student engagement. We find that students do not adhere to assigned roles, such as manager, recorder, and skeptic, but rather take on roles according to their personalities.

 Literacy is a factor in whether or not cognition in an individual is developed or underdeveloped. An individual's orthographic and letter knowledge are factors in continuing reading development in their native language. The purpose of this study is to examine whether a week of literacy intervention will improve visual spatial processing in illiterate adults. In this study, a Mandarin Figure Matching Test will be administered to a group of individuals who lack literacy skills. This test will consist of individuals matching a series of Mandarin characters. The test will be administered before intervention and after intervention to see if methods used were effective in improving visual spatial processing. Not only will this clarify our understanding of speed of change in visual processing systems, but these findings may help educators improve literacy interventions, determine the ideal training length, and encourage illiterate individuals to attend short-term literacy events.

We collaborated with students in an educational program to teach literacy skills as part of a service learning training program. Individuals with little to no verbal literacy exposure were taught linguistic skills to examine if there were any improvements on verbal word association and language comprehension in the mental lexicon. Language growth was measured through pre and post-tests that were modified for each individual's literacy comprehension and skill level. Participants completed a base test that assessed the verbal level of literacy prior to our training and a secondary test to determine their specific literacy category. This specific category was reassessed after training to determine the level of language growth. We hypothesized that seven days of literacy exposure would have a significant improvement on language growth, specifically word association and language comprehension in the mental lexicon. Knowing whether one week is sufficient to language growth is crucial for educators who intervene in populations where time is limited. If successful, this program will be implemented in a one week service trip to the Dominican Republic. <br>

 Bacterial infection is a leading cause of death worldwide. The gradual emergence of populations of antibiotic-resistant bacteria resulting from use, misuse and outright abuse of antibiotics has today become a major public health problem of global proportions. The development of new, potent, and less toxic agents from natural sources against various infectious agents is an urgent medical need. In the last decade, a wide range of diverse, novel classes of natural antibiotics has been isolated from different snake species. The aims of this study were to investigate antimicrobial activity of 24 different snake venoms from families Viperidae and Elapidae against 6 different clinical bacteria strains including <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> (Gram-positive bacteria) and <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Salmonella enterica</i>, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, and <i>Klebsiella oxytoca</i> (Gram-negative bacteria) using the disc diffusion method. Several snake venoms showed activity against three to four different pathogenic bacteria. The most susceptibility bacterium was <i>S. aureus</i>. <i>Bothrops moojeni</i> and <i>Crotalus durissus terrificus</i> venoms exhibited the most potent activity against <i>S. aureus</i>.

 Freshwater sustainability in arid and semi-arid regions is highly uncertain under increasing demands due to population growth and urban development as well as limited water supply. In particular, six largest cities by population among the top twenty U.S. cities are located in Texas (TX), which also experience high variability in water availability due to frequent droughts and floods. Similarly, several regions in Arizona (AZ) are rapidly growing (e.g. Phoenix and Tucson) despite receiving scanty rainfall. Thus, the goal of this study is to analyze water use and water scarcity in watersheds within TX and AZ between 1985 and 2010.
<br>
<br>
 The water use data from U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is analyzed by Hydrological Unit Code (HUC) – 8 within TX and AZ. Total freshwater use by county during 1985 and 2010 were converted into water use by HUC-8 using geospatial analysis. Water availability will be estimated by using a large-scale Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model. The VIC model will be calibrated and validated for multiple basins located in Texas and Arizona. The VIC model simulated total streamflow will be aggregated across the 1/8-degree grids that are within each HUC-8 to estimate water supply. The excess water for upstream HUC-8s (= local supply minus demands) will be routed, in addition to locally generated streamflow, to estimate water availability in downstream HUC-8s. Water Scarcity Index, defined as the ratio of total freshwater demand to supply, will be estimated during 1985 and 2010 to evaluate the effects of water availability and demands on scarcity. Finally, water scarcity and use will be analyzed by HUC-8s within TX and AZ. Such information could be useful in future water resources management and planning.

Children are to be placed in the least restrictive environment possible, which is currently perceived to be family based care rather than children's homes. Currently, children's homes are labeled as congregate care along with psychiatric institutions, residential treatment facilities, and emergency shelters. However, children's homes are seen as a “last resort"" choice when trying to place children. This quantitative study assesses the perception between children's homes and family based foster homes when considering the placement of a child. A total of 50 participants are surveyed using convenience and purposive sampling. Researchers use a multi-method survey approach, which includes 22 pre-developed true/false, open-ended, and demographic questions. The Systems Perspective describes multiple entities working together to support a whole structure. When placing a child, there are various child-based agencies collaborating to ensure the betterment of the child. The hypotheses center on positive and negative perceptions, and the professionals' understanding about children's homes, specifically Child Protective Services. Results suggest, child placement professionals need to be educated on the different levels of care such as family care institutions and congregate care in order to effectively place a child in the most least restrictive setting.<br>

 Abstract<br>
 Competency-based education (CBE) is an approach that measures mastery of competencies rather than seat time. The goal of CBE is to offer flexible, affordable and quality post-secondary education to a growing base of non-traditional learners (Bonnie Ordonez, 2014). Currently, non-traditional students account for nearly half of all the students in higher education (Douglas-Gabriel, 2016). Existing research however, is limited as to how well students fare in CBE programs, particularly in comparison to traditional degree models (Kelly &amp; Columbus, <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cbe2.1042/full#cbe21042-bib-0006"">2016</a>). The current study analyzes results from a survey completed by alumni of both a CBE program and its traditional counterpart at Texas A&amp;M University-Commerce. This survey was administered with the goal of evaluating both student satisfaction with their degree program, and post-completion outcomes. Student demographics provide insights related to the learners who enroll in completer-focused degree programs. The analysis, results and discussion in this study includes three key areas of dissimilarities in the findings: staff &amp; faculty interaction, affordability &amp; acceleration, and post-graduation outcomes. Although both program graduates rated their respective degrees quite highly, through a visual description, we will show how the results suggest superior outcomes for the CBE program relative to the traditional program. Furthermore, an analysis on the transfer cohort graduation rates for both the programs indicate that CBE students are graduating at a 57% faster pace than students in the traditional program. This study provides evidence to support the notion that CBE can aid students in accomplishing positive outcomes. <br>

 <b> Abstract</b><br>
<br>
 The Sports Management department is faced with the issue of optimizing the sale of tickets with the objective of maximizing the revenue and ensuring highest possible occupancy for the sporting events held by it. One way of accomplishing this is by introducing analytics into the data on reservation and tickets sales, based on different sporting events held between the universities. This analysis would not only help in identifying hidden trends and patterns in the data but also greatly assist in understanding customer preferences towards any particular sport, which can be further used to determine the ticket price and formulating the marketing and sales promotion strategy.<br>
<br>
 The Data analytics begins with cleaning and converting the raw data on the reservation of tickets and customer information into a meaningful and useful format. In order to determine the association of one sport with other sport, the Excel solver tool can be used along with also the other softwares such as Tableau, Business Intelligence which will contribute to the analysis. The Association rules technique in Excel solver helps in determining the association, probability and likelihood of the customer purchasing tickets of a particular game if he purchases a ticket for another particular game. Before the association between two ticket purchases can be determined we need to convert the raw data into binary format so as to make it usable and accurate. <br>
<br>
 The results can also be used to determine the trend in the sale of tickets as the date of game approaches. This would help the department to understand the tickets sale volumes, fluctuations and assist the sales team to decide on introducing promotional offers accordingly such as early booking discount, promoting giveaways etc. to encourage buyers.<br>
<br>
 The objective of this research and analysis is to provide suitable recommendations to the Sports department that would help it achieve its objective of maximization of sales revenue and ensuring highest possible occupancy for the sporting events.<br>

What is the minimum number of people you have to invite to a party to guarantee that there will be either a set of 4 people who all like each other or a set of 3 who all hate each other? The answer is the Ramsey number R(3,4)=9. Ramsey numbers are studied in the subfield of mathematics called combinatorics using colorings of complete graphs. They play a critical role in network design and theoretical computer science, but they are very difficult to compute exactly because the space of all colorings is massive and the time required to check each one is large. We present a method to efficiently search this space using a combination of Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods (like simulated annealing, Metropolis-Hastings, and Tabu search) and the power of parallelized computation on GPU hardware.<br>",TBD

Neutron stars in binary star systems accrete matter from their neighboring star, causing their surface temperature to rise. When accretion stops, the neutron star cools. Using cooling data on neutron star MXB1659-29, MESA, and dStar, this research modeled neutron star cooling by varying attributes including radius, mass, density, pressure, core temperature, and impurity in order to determine the composition of the star. The lowest chi squared value received has been 6.92. The model that output a chi squared of 6.92 had an impurity parameter close to zero, suggesting that MXB1659-29 is mostly pure.

 The ability to perceive emotion is believed to be both innate and is subjected to the influence of pitch, duration and prosody of speech patterns. Emotion perception is a critical component in social interactions. It is not “what” we say but “how” we say it determine our interpretation of speaker's moods. Limited information is available on cross language comparison. The purpose of this study is to investigate the accuracy of emotion perception with and without linguistic information. The subjects of this study were 21 young adults with normal hearing. The group was presented with 14 voice recording samples from various Youtube videos. Kahoot was used in the data collection process. The four emotions used in this study were sad, happy, fear and angry. Voice samples consisted or both the Thai and English Language were randomly mixed with various emotions. The results indicated that students were able to accurately identify the emotion at 80.4% with information presented auditory. There was a trend for subjects to misidentify negative emotions such as fear, anger, and sadness with one another. Happiness was more commonly misinterpreted as anger. This study showed that young adults with normal hearing can properly recognize the emotion being portrayed. Further study is to enhance voice samples, included Spanish language and using subjects with hearing loss for making comparison.<br>",TBD

<br>
 <b> ABSTRACT</b><br>
<br>
 The Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas is subject to high temperatures and insolation which can lead to an increase of sunburn on citrus fruit. Sunburn can affect the characteristics of fruit, such as sugar content, mineral composition, and membrane structure which decrease fruit quality. Sunburn in citrus fruit can be mitigated by foliar sprays of calcium and reflectant, while anti-transpirants can be used to control the plant heat stress and may reduce sunburn in fruit, leaves and other tissues. In this study, the effects of calcium acetate, an anti-transpirant and their combination on the incidence of sunburn, tree water stress, fruit quality and yield of grapefruit were evaluated. Data were collected on leaf temperature, relative humidity, stem water potential, and stomatal conductance, and fruit temperature, sunburn incidence, and juice quality throughout the 2016 and 2017 seasons. Temperate and relative humidity data were collected using sensors installed directly in the tree canopy. Fruit temperature was recorded on four quadrants (N, S, E, W) of tree canopy, fruit temperature significantly varied with treatment. Calcium sprays reduced fruit temperature, while the anti-transpirant increased fruit temperature relative the untreated control. In contrast, the anti-transpirant showed lower stomatal activity as indicated by the stomatal conductance thereby resulting in lower relative humidity. The proportion of fruits affected by sunburn varied with the canopy quadrant and treatment. Significantly more fruits with sunburn were recorded on the west side of tree canopy, with the lowest proportion of fruit with sunburn was found on the north side of tree. Similarly, trees treated with anti-transpirant had more fruit affected by sunburn compared to other treatments. The anti-transpirant sprays resulted in smaller fruit possibly as a result of lower water allocation for fruit development and had higher maturity index. Calcium spray showed bigger fruit and had higher yield. In conclusion, fruit and leaf temperatures and stress parameters were significantly affected by the calcium and anti-transpirant treatments. This study is still ongoing to determine the most suitable application time to prevent sunburn and improve fruit quality and yield. <br>",TBD

 I will analyze the representation of the female characters in “Vampiro” and “La rama seca.” Although these two narratives were written sixty years apart, their representation of child abuse is the same. Pardo Bazán and Matute show the reader different types of loneliness. Because of the characters' solitude, their humanness is erased, as they are reduced to mere decorative objects. Even though none of them are actual victims of physical abuse, the way they are spoken to and the treatment they receive by the nearest people, perpetually damage them. The female protagonists of both stories, Inesiña in “Vampiro” and the Mediavilla girl in “la rama seca”, are still considered minors. Despite not being the same age, they are both still in need of a parental figure that can guide them and is concern about their physical and emotional safety. This analysis will focus on the different ways the people around Inesiña and Mediavilla girl first abuse them, then dehumanize them, and finally turn them into objects.",TBD

<b>ABSTRACT </b>Education is ever evolving. Some education practices that were effective twenty years ago are not as effective anymore. Current college students were most likely born within the mid 1980's to early 2000's year range. Individuals born in this time frame are typically classified under the term “Net Generation” or a “Millennial.” They are being raised in a time where technology is making major advancements. Students becoming more technologically advanced has caused educators to become more technology friendly in their instructional styles. This study was designed to determine what education method is more effective for students to retain information over an agriculture topic. The topic chosen was Genetically Modified Organisms, or GMOs. Identical information was presented to the test subjects in three different formats. Those formats include: face-to-face lecture with accompanying power point presentation, social media video, and colorful pamphlet. A test pool of 101 students were given a pre-test assessing their current knowledge of GMOs. They were then separated into three equal groups. Thirty-three participated in the lecture, 33 in the video, and 35 in the pamphlet. Five days later a post-survey was distributed to the same students in their residential halls. All tests were collected and matched by individual's name and university identification number. Analysis included descriptive statistics and <i><em>t-</em></i>tests, processed through the SPSS program. Results showed that there was no statistically significant difference between the three educational methods, using a descriptive statistics, general linear model. However, the post-test scores were statistically significantly higher than the pre-test scores, <i><em>F</em></i> (1, 95) = 1,150.25, <i><em>p</em></i> = .000. Further, the interaction between pre- and post-tests and education method were statistically significant, where each of the post-test scores were statistically significantly higher than each of the pre-test scores, <i><em>F </em></i>(2, 95) = 14.87, <i><em>p</em></i> = .034. From this research, it can be concluded that all three educational methods are effective in educating university students.<br>",TBD

In 2015, a video surfaced showing the development of a chicken embryo in an artificial culture vessel (Cheer, 2016). To test the reproducibility of the methodology, a similar environment was reproduced using materials available in America. The expected hatchability of embryos in the culture vessel should be significantly less than what was published in the study featured in the video (Tahara et al, 2014). Fertilized eggs were obtained from various sources and allowed to rest for 12 to 24 hours at room temperature. The eggs were then placed in an incubator for 24 to 48 hours for pre-incubation. Following pre-incubation the eggs were carefully cracked, transferred to the culture vessels, and placed into the incubator. The embryos were observed for development. The culture vessels consisted of a plastic drinking cup with a hole two cm from the bottom of the cup to allow for oxygen delivery at a later time. Approximately 40 mL of 0.01 percent benzalkonium chloride was added to the bottom of the cup. Plastic wrap was molded into an egg shape and suspended in the cup 10 cm from the bottom. Small perforations were created in the film to allow for even gas exchange. Two mL of deionized water was placed in the bottom of the plastic wrap. Approximately 250 mg of calcium lactate pentahydrate was added to the water. The contents of the culture vessel and the embryo were covered with a plastic wrap cover and secured with a rubber band to maintain a constant humidity level. The average length of survival is three to four days (n=54) with the maximum length of survival being 17 days. These results suggest that the reproducibility using materials available in the United States is significantly hindered. <br>

 Reports on Dockum aquifer shows that this aquifer can be an important source of groundwater for irrigation, public supply, oil field activity, livestock and manufacturing. The downside of using this water is high total dissolved solids, hardness and declining water levels. The solution to this problem would be to reduce the contaminant levels in the water to standard accepted values so that it can be reused thus preventing decline in water levels. It was proposed to use the plant derived polysaccharides as adsorbents/ flocculants to reduce the contaminant levels without effecting the ecosystem<br>
<br>
 Polysaccharides were extracted from fenugreek seeds and psyllium husk using standard methods. Tamarind polysaccharide is commercially available and was used as it is. All the derived polysaccharides were derived from food grade plant material. They are non- toxic and eco- friendly. The polysaccharides were characterized using FTIR. Water samples from different wells from Dockum aquifer were collected and brought to our lab. Collected water samples were characterized for the following water quality parameters suspended solids (SS), Total dissolved solids (TDS), nitrates, phosphates, chlorides, pH, sulfates and boron. <br>
<br>
 Lab scale adsorption experiments were done to study the removal efficiency of the polymers in removal of TDS, chloride, sulfate, boron, nitrates and phosphates using series of batch absorption experiments. The contaminants concentrations were measured before and after the treatment to determine the efficiency of the polysaccharides as treatment agents. Hach spectrophotometers and titrations experiments and Ion chromatograph were used to detect contaminant concentrations. The concentrations of the polymers were varied by adding different volume of the polymer solutions. Till now the volume varied from 20 mL to 40 mL in 500 ml of the water samples. Gravimetric methods were used for solid measurements. Spectrophotometric techniques and Ion chromatographic methods were used to measure the sulfates, phosphates, chlorides and Boron. Conductometric titrations were also used to measure the concentration of sulfates. This method was compared with spectrophotometric methods for greater accuracy. The contact time of the polymers with water were varied from immediately to 2 hours to determine the best contact time for maximum removal of contaminants using different polymer doses.<br>
<br>
 From the experiments so far we were able to deduce that the green polymers used are capable of removing the suspended solids, total dissolved solids, nitrates, boron, phosphates, chlorides and sulfates. We are still in the process of analyzing the data. More experiments are planned to determine the best polymer or combination of polymers, doses and contact time for maximum removal efficiency.<br>",TBD

 Students on college campuses around the country are becoming more vocal about food insecurity and homelessness on their respective campus. As a result, the number of Food Pantries on college campuses are multiplying. While there is no official count, membership in the College and University Food Bank Alliance has quadrupled in the past two years (CUFBA, 2016). <br>
<br>
 The problem of food insecurity and homelessness is becoming more common among college students in the US population as a whole in which 14% of households experience food insecurity each year. According to a study conducted by Dubick, Matthews, and Cady (2016) which looked at the prevalence of hunger on PWI campus' (predominantly White institutions), 48% of the students surveyed identified as food insecure and 57% of those who were self-identified as “food insecure” were African Americans. In addition, 64% percent of “food insecure” students were also experiencing housing insecurity.<br>
<br>
 The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of food insecurity and homelessness among students at a southern Historically Black University, located in a identified food desert, to address the gap in research that exist regarding this phenomenon among HBCUs. Overall, 74% of the participants (N=569, .05 confidence level) reported knowing someone who has experienced hunger during their time on their HBCU campus and 61% reported to know someone who had experienced homelessness while attending the HBCU. Correlation analysis did indicate the higher cost of the purchased meal plan the more food insecure an individual was. Implications of the study will be discussed.<br>

 Several plant breeding research on cowpea have increased its yield, however the yield is still very low (2000 kg ha-1). There is need to use other approaches to see if the yield could be increased further. The permutation of metabolic pathway has been applied to double the yield of peanut. Purple hull cowpea was planted on pvamu farm in raised beds (4 x 4 ft.) filled with top soil mixed with peat moss soil mix. Each was planted in triplicate bed to be treated respectively. The specially formulated mineral nutrients were applied three times. The first treatment was applied three weeks germination, the second treatment at flowering and the third treatment right before maturity. When the leaves turned yellow, the pods were harvested box by box and then left on the green house floor for three weeks to dry. The pods were then shelled by hand then the dry grain were weighed box by box and their average was calculated. The control yield was 3644.2 Kg ha-1. The boxes that were fertilized with regular fertilizer yielded 5469.4 Kg ha-1. The boxes that were fertilized with NNPK yielded 6559 Kg ha-1. The fertilized with the special Prairie View A&amp;M treatment yielded 7600 Kg ha-1. These specially formulated mineral composition are specially designed to increased crop yield by permutation of metabolic pathways.<br>

 <b>ABSTRACT</b><br>
<br>
 In this study, caprine casein hydrolysates were produced by enzyme hydrolysis of caprine casein. Two enzymes, pepsin and trypsin, were used to produce two species of caprine casein hydrolysates. These two hydrolysate species were evaluated for their prebiotic potential by determining if these can support the growth of various probiotic bacteria. Growth studies of the most widely used probiotic bacteria, <i>Bifidobacterium </i>and <i>Lactobacillus</i>, were evaluated. It was determined that caprine casein hydrolysates significantly (<i>P&lt;0.05</i>) supported growth with the selected probiotic bacteria. With trypsin-treated caprine casein probiotic bacteria <i>B. bifidum, B. breve</i>, <i>L. bulgaricus, and L. delbrueckii </i>grew better than with pepsin-treated caprine casein. Caprine casein hydrolysates showed consistent prebiotic activity in the selected probiotics during the early experimental period (12, 24 h) at 37 oC. Therefore, this study enables the determination of the roles of caprine casein hydrolysate in probiotic strains, which can facilitate developing novel combinational approaches by simultaneously using caprine casein hydrolysate and specific probiotics.<br>

 Correctional Education falls under what is known as tertiary education (Ubah, 2001). It is also known as prison education (Ballantine, 2017; Ubah, 2001) or inmate education that encompasses any number of educational activities occurring inside a prison (Ballantine, 2017). Prison education consists of formal educational institutions that build on secondary education (UNESCO, 2011). Correctional educational programming includes vocational, workforce, or academic training received by incarcerated persons and is a fundamental component of rehabilitative programming (U.S. Department of Education, 2015). Studies have shown direct, significant, and positive indications of higher education on the reduction of recidivism (Hrabowski &amp; Robbi, 2002; RAND Corporation, 2013). One reason this is important is that at year-end 2013, many had reported up to 2.3 million people incarcerated in United States' jails and prisons (Glaze &amp; Haberman, 2013; Segura, 2013; Wagner &amp; Rabuy, 2016). This fact is reflected in statistical data regarding not only the sheer number of American citizens incarcerated, but moreover disproportionate incarceration of African American males (Alexander, The New Jim Crow, 2012) and increasingly females (Sentencing Project, 2015). Mass incarceration has had a rippling effect on marginal communities, resulting in families being torn apart and damaging lives (Yates, 2009). Ex-offenders occupy one of the most marginalized positions in America (Geiger, 2006). Moreover, Historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) have a unique educational history founded for the purpose of providing collegiate education to black people (Brown III, 2001), or marginalized people. Marginalization is both a condition and a process that prevents individuals and groups from full participation in social, economic, and political life enjoyed by the wider society (Alakhunova, Diallo, del Campo, &amp; Tallarico, 2015). Prisoners and ex-offenders, particularly black prisoners and ex-offenders are among that group. As such, this study seeks to explore the narratives and philosophies of correctional educational leaders at the nation's first correctional education program at a Historically Black College or University for black offenders prior to their release from jail or prison.<br>

<b>ABSTRACT: <br>
</b> From the late 1990's to the early 2000's, the overall inmate population and mentally ill population have both grown exponentially. This level of growth has placed extreme pressure on the third component of the criminal justice system, incarceration, resulting in it facing preeminent issues. Many preexisting factors have contributed to the rise of prison populations, such as deinstitutionalization and criminalization of the mentally ill. However, the implementation of mental health courts has served to reduce recidivism rates for institutions who graduate inmates from their programs. That said, mental health courts are not well understood and thus there is a gap in our academic understanding of mental health courts and their function. This paper represents part of an undergraduate thesis which will explore the issue of Mental Health Courts in Texas. This paper will provide an overview of some of the main mental health courts in Texas, describing the kinds of offenders who participate and their recidivism rates, among other demographic factors such as race, gender and age. In this way, we hope to begin to develop an understanding of the Mental Health courts which operate in Texas. <br>

 Abstract
</strong><br>
<br>
 Competency-based education (CBE) is a system combining a planned and transparent approach to curricular design with an academic model in which the time it takes to demonstrate competencies varies and the expectations about learning are held constant (CBE Network, 2017). The U.S. Department of Education has suggested that allowing students to self-pace through mastery and demonstration of competencies can reduce both time and financial obligations (USDA, 2017). The CBE model presents a unique opportunity for higher education to begin thinking in terms of mastery of competencies, rather than the traditional time-based unit. Although the list prices of CBE models appear cost effective in comparison to traditional higher education models, little research has comprehensively examined and reported on the actual completion and affordability of CBE programs (Kelchen, 2014). The Institute for Competency-Based Education (ICBE), based at A&amp;M-Commerce has created targeted metrics designed to track CBE outcomes, and has continuously collected and reported on essential data such as time to completion and associated costs. The current study evaluated student time and cost saving for 257 students who graduated from the Texas Affordable Baccalaureate (TAB) Bachelors of Applied Arts and Sciences (BAAS) degree in Organizational Leadership, the first competency-based degree offered at A&amp;M-Commerce. The results of the study show CBE students accelerated time to degree completion by at least a year compared to transfer counterparts in traditional programs. Cost savings mirror these findings with CBE students saving up to 53% over traditional models. These findings support the claim that competency based education can result in significant financial savings and increased time to degree completion in comparison to traditional programs.

 Animal Feeding Operations (AFOs) contribute to global climate change (GCC) through the release of air pollutants such as NH3, PM, H2S, VOCs, and greenhouse gases. This study will monitor air emissions of CO2, PM2.5, PM10, O3, and H2S from multiple locations on a goat farm and characterize the hazard potential by analyzing emission rates trend. The three monitoring points selected were inside a goat barn, downwind of an irrigation pond, and manure lagoon. Teledyne API gaseous air quality monitoring instruments and Thermo Scientific aerosol monitors were used to determine concentrations over a 33 day period in the summer season. The maximum hourly average concentrations of CO2, O3, H2S, PM2.5, and PM10 inside the goat barn were 526.2 ppm; 88.3 ppb; 1.8 ppb; 161.11 µg/m3; 212.17 µg/m3 and 24.46 µg/m3 respectively. The maximum concentrations of CO2, O3, H2S, PM2.5, and PM10 at the irrigation pond were 643 ppm; 108.6 ppb; 0.8 ppb; 59.82 µg/m3; 133.71 µg/m3 respectively. The highest concentrations of CO2, O3, H2S, PM2.5, and PM10 at the manure lagoon were 414.6 ppm; 39.8 ppb; 1.9 ppb; 18.26 µg/m3; 129.35 µg/m3 respectively. The maximum concentration of air pollutants monitored was above current health and government regulated thresholds implemented by EPA/OSHA. A potential risk is present at these animal feeding operations and poses a danger to the environment and human welfare. <br>

 Northern bobwhite populations have recently been declining across their range, due in large part to habitat loss and fragmentation. The role of disease in this decline, however, has been little-studied. Our objectives include determining if northern bobwhites can be infected with reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) and the transmission method of the virus. REV has been detected in other gallinaceous birds, but not yet observed in northern bobwhites. The purpose of this study is to determine if REV may be a contributing factor to the decline of northern bobwhites. A total of 30 quail, anesthetized using isofluorane, will be inoculated with varying doses (0%, 25%, 50%, 100%) of 103.4 TCID50 of virus intramuscularly into the breast muscle. Virus detection by PCR will be performed at 6 weeks to determine infection. After determining infection, mosquitoes will be starved overnight in a feeding jar and then allowed to feed for 15 minutes on REV-infected or uninfected quail. At 15 minutes, fully engorged mosquitoes will be collected, observed under a binocular microscope for blood content, and frozen at -80°C. Based on previous research involving Japanese quail, we expect to find that northern bobwhites are susceptible to REV infection. We also expect to find that mosquitoes are viable vectors for REV. All experiments and analyses will be concluded prior to the beginning of the conference.<br>

 Review of Education Code “Safe Schools”: Implanting Bullying prevention in School Districts of the Coastal Bend of Texas<br>
<br>
 <b>Project Abstraction </b>(Maximum 200 Words)</strong><br>
<br>
 A recent study confirms that bullying in schools can lead to unstable mental and physical health of the victims and often leads to poor academic performance. However, prevention and early intervention efforts from the schools can play an important role in the elimination of the problem of bullying (Junoven &amp; Graham, 2014). In the present research, we reviewed the bullying policy in the state education code and compared it to the bullying policies of multiple schools. With this research, to illustrate the schools influence on bullying and how their policies play a role in the occurrence of bullying in their districts. The present study randomly selected school districts (N=15) in the coastal bend regions (Region 1 through 5), and collected qualitative data from the districts' codes of conducts and policies. The research included extraction of important data relevant to bullying and was coded. The research is ongoing and strives to find emergent differences/similarities between the schools policy and the overt discussion of bullying. Preliminary results from the extracted data indicate the selected schools differ tremendously in their coverage, handling of policy on bullying issues. We discuss why this matters and what schools can do to improve and homogenize bullying policy.<br>

 <i>Capitella</i> species are found throughout the world's oceans and are often cited as environmental sentinels. However, it is apparent that <i>Capitella</i> has several cryptic species, commonly cited as <i>C</i>. <i>capitata</i> due to the limited morphological characters and several lineages having the same chaetal arrangement. Our research has focused on assessing species boundaries in this complex in the Northern Gulf of Mexico (GoM) and Floridian Ecoregions. We have sequenced individuals of <i>C</i>. cf. <i>capitata</i> and <i>C</i>. cf. <i>aciculata</i> (distinguished by acicular spines on the first two chaetigers) collected from Texas and Florida GoM coasts and <i>C</i>. cf. <i>caribaeorum</i> from the species' type locality in Miami, Florida.

 ABSTRACT</strong><br>
<br>
 Converting bermudagrass pastures into native species prairies with high diversity is a multi-stage process. Factors include cost, timing, seed and equipment availability, climate, soils and management limit success. Bermudagrass has many adaptations that resist suppression: fast growing, dense and resilient. These agronomically desirable traits create problems when converting pastures to diverse grasslands dominated by native plants. Because bermudagrass is so aggressive it easily out-competes native species, especially during the first few years when native seedlings are most vulnerable. Common range control practices, such as prescribed burning, are mostly futile, because they are usually used while bermudagrass is dormant. <br>
<br>
 This project compared seedbed preparation and native seed mixes to determine which are most effective at converting bermudagrass monocultures into diverse native grasslands that mimic prairies once widely present in Texas. The three seedbed preparation methods were no-till and drill, disc and drill and disc, broadcast and roll. <br>
<br>
 No-till drills have been increasing in popularity in recent years with the growing problem of erosion, but this method could present a problem with weed suppression. On the other hand, disking can cause flushes of quick-growing weeds that suppress native seedlings. Drilling places seeds directly into the ground, ensuring seed-soil contact, but can also bury the seed too deep where it cannot emerge. Broadcasting allows for more dispersed seeding, but cannot always guarantee proper seed-soil contact. <br>
<br>
 Our trial took place in two locations following five bermudagrass suppression approaches. We measured seedling emersion and ground cover 2 and 4 months following planting. <br>
<br>
 Objective: increase biodiversity through native species in monoculture pastures, increase soil health which will supply habitat and food sources to native wildlife, especially ground-dwelling birds such as bobwhite quail.<br>

 The effect of pH on bull semen fertility has been extensively studied. However, no study has correlated collection method and pH or pH and its effect on motility over time. In this on-going study, bulls housed at a collection facility in south Texas were ejaculated using either an artificial vagina or an electroejaculator. Within five minutes of ejaculation, pH and temperature were taken using a three-point calibrated pH probe. Initial motility and morphology were determined visually before antibiotics and semen extender were added. Semen with satisfactory motility and morphology was frozen the same day, then and thawed 1 wk later. Motility was recorded at 0 hr and 3 hr post thaw. No correlation was found between pH and gross motility (p=.97). A positive correlation was found between 0 hr post-thaw and 3 hr post-thaw motility (r=0.488, p=0.004). A significant difference in pH was found between collection method (p=0.002), with electroejaculations measuring at a higher pH than artificial vagina collections. Data collection is still on-going at this time. H<br>

Drug delivery systems increase the therapeutic efficiency of the chemotherapeutic agent by controlling the rate at which the agent is released from the carrier to the systemic circulation or tissues, minimizing its interaction with non-pathological sites. Available delivery systems exhibit high toxicity. However, natural biomaterial polysaccharides are highly stable, non-toxic, hydrophilic, biodegradable, and abundantly available. These polysaccharides also have low manufacturing costs compared to current lipid-based and protein-based delivery systems. In the research so far, a non-toxic plant-derived drug delivery system has been developed. A series of tissue culture experiments have been performed to study the safety and toxicity of this polysaccharide-based drug-delivery system at varying doses in different cancer cell lines. The results have indicated that this drug-delivery system does not display toxicity in regards to <i>in vitro </i>studies. Additional research including <i>in vivo</i> mice models are performed to further study the safety and toxicity effects of the polysaccharide-based drug delivery system. The overall goal of the current research is to maximize the effectiveness of the chemotherapeutic agent when combined with the newly developed plant-based drug delivery system. Current research focuses on repeating and furthering the cell proliferation experiments to determine the most effective concentrations of the anti-cancer drug and plant-based drug delivery system. The results, although preliminary, are promising as we continue to experiment with different dosages. The current study is ongoing and is continuing to make progress.<br>",TBD

 During development, the brain has the ability to absorb vast amounts of information through formal or informal learning; however, formal and informal learning situations may differentially alter some aspects of cognition. One cognitive function is attention. Attention is defined as a concentrated mental activity towards a stimulus. Although there are multiple defining characteristics of attention, our main emphasis will be on attentional control and executive functioning, as this is the aspect of attention most likely influenced by formal schooling. To determine if a small amount of formal schooling in early life impacts attention, adults with little formal education will perform the 
<i>Attention</i><i> </i><i>Networking</i><i> </i><i>Task</i> (ANT), a task which measures three aspects of attention: alerting, orientation, and executive function. We hypothesize that the amount of formal education obtained during childhood will be positively correlated with attention ability as measured by the ANT. It is also possible that formal education later in life may improve attention in these individuals. To test the latter prediction, performance on the ANT task will be compared before and after one week of formal education in the evenings. It is expected that even this minimal exposure to formal education will increase executive function. Knowing whether a small amount of formal schooling in early life impacts attention in later life will be helpful in understanding how attention develops, and effects of formal schooling later in life will have implications regarding development and treatment of adult Attention Deficit Disorder. <br>

Connecting of the parallels within Shakespeare's “Antony and Cleopatra” and Father John Misty's “I Love You, Honeybear” is important to the process of understanding literary clichés that have spanned the course of 500 years. By understanding the motivation behind the authors' inclusion of a character with a desire for the bad girl, the works begin to reveal truths about the nature of human desire. This essay will serve as a contribution to the canon of research and analysis of fictional works that can be analyzed to provide insight into the human condition of love and desire. <br>

 Several factors are important in the decision making process associated with shoaling, such as size, coloration, parasite load, and familiarity. These proximate cues, however, may be less effective in environmentally disturbed habitats, such as those with high turbidity levels. Hence, the objectives of this study was to determine whether turbidity affected shoaling behavior in two gregarious minnow species and if shoaling behavior differed when only visual cues were available versus a combination of visual and olfactory cues. For each set of experiments, four assays were conducted per test tank for each species. Assay 1 required both end chambers to be empty; there were no statistical differences between sides for either species regardless of turbidity or proximate cue availability. Assay 2 required three conspecifics to be placed in one end while the other end remained empty; blacktail shiner showed significant preferences for conspecifics in clear water, whereas red shiner showed no preference. Assay 3 required three heterospecifics to be placed in one end while the other end remained empty; blacktail shiner showed no preference in clear water, while red shiner spent significantly more time with heterospecifics. Assay 4 required three individuals of one species in one end compartment and three individuals of the other species in the opposite end; neither species consistently spent more time on one side versus the other in clear water. These results suggest that environmental disturbances can differentially affect organismal behavior, which could impact population and community dynamics.<br>

 Seagrasses are the only group of flowering plants to have recolonized the sea. They form “beds” of many individuals in shallow coastal waters around the world including the Gulf of Mexico. Seagrass beds often form the foundation of coastal marine ecosystems, performing vital tasks such as nutrient cycling and acting as a habitat and nursery for many different marine organisms. Genetic diversity is a vital aspect of seagrass conservation because it provides the raw material for environmental adaptation and evolution. One aspect of genetic diversity, genotypic (clonal) diversity, has been demonstrated to be strongly correlated with seagrass bed viability. We analyzed genotypic diversity of <i>Halodule wrightii</i> at three different sampling scales from sites along the Texas Coast. Our purpose was two-fold: (1) to determine which scale most efficiently captures the bulk of genotypic diversity at a location, and (2) to determine if <i>H. wrighttii </i>clonal expansion occurs using a <i>phalanx</i> (monoclonal) or <i>guerilla</i> (intermingled, polyclonal) growth strategy. Results showed that the greatest degree of genotypic diversity was captured at the largest scale (6 x 30 m grid). While smaller sampling scales (60 x 80 cm grid, 10 cm core) did detect unique genotypes, most of those found were also represented at the largest scale. They also showed that <i>H. wrightii</i> exhibits a <i>guerilla</i> growth strategy, which has the potential to increase outcrossing opportunities among adjacent clones.<br>

We predict hatch-year doves will have higher annual mortality than adults. Upon review of recent literature, we hypothesize that doves breed later in the summer than previous estimates. We used a MRPP analysis in program R to determine subpopulations. We will use Program MARK to analyze 89,297 bandings, of which 3,615 were recovered, to produce estimates stratified by each subpopulation. We will use molt scores of hatch-year doves recorded during annual banding operations to assess the length of the breeding season and update knowledge of breeding chronology. Furthermore, we will examine weather covariates, banding location, molt score and other factors which may influence survival on an annual basis.

 <b>Abstract</b><br>
<br>
 Electric Vehicles (EV) are considered one of the most promising strategies to reduce air pollution from mobile sources. However concerns related to the reduced autonomy of EV, known as “Range anxiety”, has been consistently identified as one of the main obstacles to market penetration of EV, leading to speculation that as long as a robust Electric Vehicle Charging Stations is not available EV will be restricted to urban drivers and as secondary vehicles for households. Current Superchargers and planned improvements, which could allow charging in 5 minutes, might cause overload on the electric grids. Therefore the use of renewable energy and batteries has been considered as a very good alternative to overcome this issue in addition to maximizing environmental advantages. This research applied GIS methodologies to data provided by the TxDot, US Department of Energy and wind data from NREL to evaluate the placement of current EVCS in regards to traffic patterns, wind energy availability and traffic growth forecast. The results will be useful to companies such as TESLA and to Federal, State and local governments to assess current placement of EVCS and improve the planning of future charging stations, incentivizing the use of EV in Texas.<br>

 Wearable skin-like materials have potential to transform how inexpensive electromechanical systems are developed, and the way medicine is practiced. The key challenge of soft materials remains in the ability to deliver the desired complex motions of the human hand and replicate its geometry. The main objective is to design and develop an actuator that creates significant force and uses minimal air pressure. The first step was to design the fingers and the palm using AutoCAD. After the design process is completed, the molds are 3D printed. The skin materials will be poured into the mold and peeled upon curing. The mold design will impact the behavior of the actuator. Pneumatic actuators are made of an empty shell that is built using skin-like polymers. To manipulate the behavior of the actuator, the surface of the actuator requires laced polymers that limit the movement of the actuator using the air pressure. To build the body of the shell, Dragon Skin a commercial off the shelf polymer is used. We tested the actuation at various air pressures demonstrating relaxed state before actuation and flexed during actuation at 30 psi by varying the pressure from 0-100 psi. The force exerted by the thumb actuator is measured, and Force vs. pressure data is obtained and compared to various fingers in the hand.

 Epilepsy affects over 65 million people worldwide and approximately 2.3 million people in the United States (Press et al., 2015 p. 49). One in twenty-six Americans will develop epilepsy at some point in their lifetime. “The estimated direct and indirect annual cost of epilepsy in the U.S. is $15.5 billion.” (Rosenburg et al. 2015 p. 747). The most common treatment used by physicians are Anti-Epileptic Drugs (AEDs). This form of treatment can get expensive for patients and families of patients with epilepsy. Advances in medicines, therapies and technology have opened the door to options in treatments for patients and families of patients dealing with epilepsy. Governor Abbot recently signed Senate Bill 339. The Texas Compassionate-Use Act allows a licensed Neurologist or Psychiatrist to prescribe patients with “intractable epilepsy, a seizure disorder in which the patient's seizures have been treated with two or more appropriately chosen and maximally titrated antiepileptic drugs that have failed to control the seizures” (Senate bill 339 2015, pp. 13-14). Although temporal lobe resective surgery is safe, “accurate detection and frank reporting of any surgical, neurological, cognitive, and/or psychological complications are of paramount importance for maximizing the safety and improving the patient's overall outcome.” (Georgiadis et al. 2013, p. 1). Vagus Nerve Stimulation has also become increasingly form of epilepsy treatment. “VNS therapy was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1997 as an adjunctive therapy for reducing seizures in patients with medically refractory epilepsy, and more than 80,000 have received treatment with VNS.” (Englot et al. 2015, p. 345). The purpose of this literature review is provide ample information for patients and parents of patients with epilepsy regarding the treatments or therapy options for such illness. <br>

ABSTRACT<br>
<br>
After years of researching and publications on the rehabilitation of stroke survivors and working directly with the stroke survivors, Dr. Joe Priest, Professor of Kinesiology in the College of Education at Tarleton State University, has realized and believed that there are still hopes for these survivors to recover physically, to a certain degree, and psychologically as well as emotionally, to a large degree, from the strokes. Based on this belief, Dr. Priest established the Laboratory for Wellness and Motor Behavior (LWMB) and started working with Kinesiology “students whose focus is in allied health"" to provide services to individuals “who have spinal cord injuries or other neurological disabilities"" (LWMB 2016). <br>
<br>
Using a team approach, the LWMB, under Dr. Priest's supervision, works closely with the patrons and their families, and the graduate assistants and interns from the Kinesiology Department. Even though relatively unknown to the general public, the Laboratory has been successful in helping the patrons and training the students. Nevertheless, in order to remain sustainable and to continuously “provide access to the benefits of exercise to those who otherwise are disregarded"" (Priest 2016), a comprehensive marketing strategy is needed to help the LWMB warrant its “success and future expansion"". We will create a private institution for Dr. Priest's project called as “Last Chance ReHab"" (LCR) and prepare a marketing plan for LCR.<br>
<br>
There are four sections in this marketing plan. A situation analysis describing LCR's current situation is presented first, followed by a SWOT analysis assessing the influences the situation has on LCR's operations. Then, based on the analyses, a set of marketing objectives resulting from the recommendation are delineated. Finally, a new marketing strategy with specific marketing activities to accomplish the objectives is created.<br>

 <a name=""_gjdgxs""></a>Our aim is to determine the influence of literacy training on phonological and letter awareness. Long-term literacy interventions have shown increases in phonological awareness and letter awareness. Although many literacy events occur over the course of a few days or even just a few hours, to the extent of our knowledge, the influence of one week literacy training is unknown. Phonological awareness is dependent on working memory, vocabulary size, and letter processing--cognitive abilities that are strengthened with literacy training. We used four tasks to measure changes in phonological and letter awareness, before and after a seven day literacy training for illiterate adults. First, a rhyme awareness task, in which participants matched pictures of rhyming words, measured phonological discrimination. Next, a letter knowledge task, in which participants were presented high and low frequency characters, was used to determine if they recognized the characters. After, a letter sound knowledge task, in which participants were presented with six consonant letters and indicated which letter matched the sound the experimenter produced, measured phoneme awareness. Finally, a reading fluency task, in which participants read a paragraph, measured reading fluency. We predict that literacy training will increase both phonological awareness and letter awareness. Knowing whether a seven day literacy training increases language skills is critical for educators implementing short-term literacy programs to improve teaching methods. <br>

Sulfate is a primary anionic constituent of groundwater and surface water and is usually present in low concentrations. However, elevated sulfate levels, especially if combined with high calcium concentrations, can cause severe scaling in water fixtures. Furthermore, sulfate can be a problem in drinking water at concentrations &gt;250 mg/L (2.6 mM), the recommended secondary standard, at which level it can have a laxative effect. Naturally occurring sulfate in Texas groundwater is primarily derived from gypsum and anhydrite rocks which are common, especially in the western half of the state. Sulfate levels were measured in groundwater samples from several wells in west Texas utilizing three different techniques – the Hach SulfaVer Method, an experimental conductometric titration method, and ion chromatography. The results from all three methods were then compared.<br>

 The U.S. is one of the world's major producers and importers of nuts, with 9% average increase in imports during the period of 1996 - 2016. Given that nuts account, on average, for 18% of the total fruit imports, it is important to empirically analyze and better understand the U.S. demand for nuts. One effective approach to do this is the estimation of import elasticities of demand. This study estimates an Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) using quarterly data reported by the USCIS for the period of 1996-2016. The parameter estimates of the AIDS model were employed to estimate the elasticities of demand for coconuts, brazil nuts, cashews, almonds, hazelnuts, walnuts, chestnuts, and pistachios. Additional adjustments were made to the empirical model in order to account for seasonality and trend, as well as to provide necessary remedies for serial correlation and endogeneity. Our results revealed that all Marshallian own-price elasticities had the expected negative signs and in absolute terms were greater than one indicating that the U.S. demand for these nuts was price-elastic. The Hicksian cross-price elasticities indicated both complementary relationships and substitutability between the selected nut types. The expenditure elasticities indicated that the majority of nuts were normal goods, with some of them being luxuries. <br>

 Over centuries, people have been using plant extracts and formulations to treat various diseases. The species <i>Phyla dulcis </i>is a tropical America plant well known for its' medicinal value and traditional use to treat cough, cold bronchitis, asthma, and colic. But the plant extracts contain high levels of camphor, giving it a bitter taste and limiting its usage as a medicinal plant in various treatments. Chitosan is a biodegradable polymer that is known to alter the production of plant metabolites, when applied as a treatment during plant growth. Hence, the purpose of this project is to analyze the camphor levels in different plant parts and to use chitosan as a treatment method to decrease the camphor levels in plant extracts. During this study, the cultivation of <i>Phyla dulcis</i> was carried out in the presence of chitosan in our greenhouse and the metabolites of different plant parts will be analyzed using GC-MS. The results of preliminary studies using GC-MS, before chitosan treatments indicated the highest camphor levels in leaves and the lowest levels were observed in stems. In the current study, chitosan treatments will be carried out for the plants growing in the green house and will be analyzed using GC-MS to observe the effect on camphor levels.<br>

 The demographics of students in public schools in our country continually change. As the student body becomes more diverse, the need for the teaching force to become more diverse also grows. According to Szecsi and Spillman (2012), as we move toward a view of celebrating assets from <i>all </i>cultures, instead of lamenting deficits, it becomes clear that with increased numbers of minority teachers the schools will have a richer multicultural knowledge base, stronger role models, more shared experiences between teachers and students, and greater numbers of insider experiences that help build bridges between cultures. The purpose of this study is to validate the need for educational leaders and education policymakers to identify effective strategies for increasing the number of minority teachers who stay in the field of education to better meet the needs of all students and societal needs. The study will use qualitative surveys of participants and interviews to find effective strategies and support systems that schools should utilize to increase the retention rate of minority teachers in the workforce. In this study, minority teachers are defined as African American and Latino teachers who will be randomly selected for participation. Participants will include minority teachers, students, and administrators. Collected data provide evidence that teachers of color offer real-life examples to minority students of future career paths and have demonstrated success in increasing academic achievement for engaging student of similar backgrounds (Bireda, Chait, and The Center for American Progress, 2011). For this reason, greater numbers of minority teachers are needed to remain in the field to increase the success of minority students in the academic setting. More studies need to be conducted for educational leaders and policymakers to incorporate the most effective retention strategies for this group of teachers. <br>

<br>
 Student retention is essential to positive graduation rates; hence it is imperative that an institution make every possible effort to assist students in successful completion of their chosen degree. Student retention remains one of the most critical policy issues for higher education (Longden, 2006). Non-returning students are those who leave the university before successfully completing a degree program. In order to evaluate why some students did not continue working on their chosen education program at A&amp;M-Commerce, 1531 students, who were enrolled in fall 2016 but not in spring 2017, were asked to complete a survey, of which 286 responded (18.7%)and 236 completed the survey in its entirety (74%). The survey consisted of 37 questions, including open and closed-ended questions, used to assess a variety of commonly cited reasons for students' early departure. Similar to past research (e.g. Kraska, 2008), the current study found four main areas served as barriers to retuning to university studies, including: job and financial reasons, university-related reasons, personal and family reasons, and academic reasons. The current study returned valuable information which helps to better understand the reasons students were unable to return. This research endeavor can assist in making evidence-based improvements with the intention of improving retention rates.<br>

<br>
 This paper examines Toni Morrison's novel, <i>Beloved</i> (1987), through the lenses of feminist theory and critical race theory, in order to pinpoint and analyze representations of transgressive motherhood throughout the text. With this understanding, the text will be explored and analyzed, taking into consideration issues of womanhood, race, and social attitudes towards traditional domesticity. In this novel, there is an inherent link between the social expectations of motherhood and the ideology of slavery. Through the analysis of Sethe's 'rememory' and her relationship with the ghostly manifestation of her deceased daughter, Morrison illustrates that woman can be held in the confines of motherhood that is similar in essence to the confines of slavery, both of which Sethe experiences and illustrates within this text. Ultimately, <i>Beloved</i> illustrates that, in both realms of slavery and motherhood, there occurs a complete loss of self and personhood, which Morrison works to criticize and challenge in the modern era. <br>

 The National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) has reported an increase in multi-drug resistant <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar I 4,[5], 12:i:- in humans and animals. <i>Salmonella </i>I 4,[5], 12:i:- is antigenically similar to <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium yet lacks the phase 2 flagellar antigen. The objective of this study was to further characterize <i>Salmonella</i> I 4,[5], 12:i:- isolated from swine and investigate differences in the phase 2 flagellar antigen region between strains. <br>
<br>
 <i>Salmonella</i> I 4,[5], 12:i:- samples were isolated using standard culture and enrichment techniques from swine head trim and cheek meat collected bimonthly over a year from a pork processing plant in the United States by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility patterns were identified by broth microdilution on a Sensititre® system. Whole genome sequencing libraries were prepared using Illumina Nextera XT kits and sequenced on Illumina MiSeq platform. Serotype was confirmed using SeqSero and resistance, plasmids, and virulence genes were identified using Center for Genomic Epidemiology website. Phylogenetic analyses were performed with Parsnp. Differences in the phase 2 flagellar antigen region were investigated using Geneious Software.<br>
<br>
 All 34 <i>Salmonella</i> I 4,[5], 12:i:- isolates sequenced were found to be multi-drug resistant(resistant to 3 or more antibiotics) with 32 isolates displaying the common ASSuT phenotype as others have previously reported. Within those 32, 25 isolates contained the PMQR gene <i>qnr</i>B. Two isolates harbored additional resistance genes to streptomycin-spectinomycin (<i>aad</i>A2), aminoglycoside (<i>aph(3')-I</i>), sulfonamide (<i>sul</i>1), beta-lactamase (<i>bla</i>SHV-12), and tetracycline (<i>tet</i>(D)). Mapping of reads to a reference <i>Salmonella</i> I 4,[5],12:i:- genome has confirmed the lack of the phase 2 flagellar antigen region and preliminary phylogenetic analyses shows a high degree of similarity between isolates. This study analyzes the presence of <i>Salmonella</i> I 4,[5], 12:i:- in swine from a pork processing facility and investigates the epidemiology of <i>Salmonella</i> I 4,[5], 12:i:- .<br>

<br>
 This paper will focus on Michael Foucault's 
<i>The History of Sexuality</i> and his idea of the repressive hypothesis. He insists that power is a productive means, and that by trying to repress sexually oriented behaviors, modern power has instead facilitated sexual discourse and heightened its presence. Foucault argues that in attempting to suppress sexuality, society instead allowed for discourse on sex to be intensified during this time period. Moreover, this paper analyzes Foucault's theory about the transition of sexuality in Western society from the 17th century till the 20th century and how it is seen in the life of the British writer, Oscar Wilde during the Victorian era. Wilde was tried and convicted for his homosexual behavior with the help of his writings such as <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> which were used as evidence to indict him. The Victorian era during which Wilde wrote, was categorized by the suppression of any unique expression of sexuality. Wilde infused his work with homosexual themes, yet as Foucault explains, by a policing of sex, authorities counter to their intentions, produced an intensification of homosexual discourse. Thus, using Foucault's theory, this paper shows how authorities propelled sexual discourse into the limelight when they used his writings as evidence to support their claims in trial to convict him on the charge of sodomy. <br>

 San Antonio, Texas, like many other large metropolitan areas, has distinct areas of high and low income. It also has a stable population of <i>Aedes aegypti</i>, the primary mosquito vector of Zika. There have been varying reports on the impact of socio-economic status and mosquito abundance. Some studies have shown that neighborhoods of high socio-economic status had higher mosquito abundance than low socio-economic areas while other studies have concluded the opposite. In the summer of 2017 we evaluated mosquito density of the three primary disease vectors, <i>Aedes aegypti</i>, <i>Aedes albopictus</i>, and <i>Culex quinquefasciatus</i> in three residential zones in San Antonio, TX, each with significant differences in socioeconomics and neighborhood quality. Neighborhood quality was assessed using a Premise Condition Assessment that evaluates home and yard maintenance. In each section, 36 Autocidal Gravid Ovitraps (AGO traps) were placed in residential front yards, 18 in areas of high socioeconomic status and 18 in areas of low economic status for a total of 108 traps. We visited each trap weekly to count and identify mosquitoes. Preliminary data suggest that socioeconomic factors and neighborhood quality do not have an impact on total mosquito numbers within the city of San Antonio, TX. However, as we continue our data collection and analysis we will evaluate if these two factors affect mosquito species differently.<br>

After spending 4 years at home with my children, Mark encouraged me to go back to school with the hopes of one day buying his practice. My goal until I purchase the practice, is to technologically innovate all work flow processes a little bit at a time. Our client base is predominately over 50 and have an aversion to change and technology. I do not want to scare them all off by making too many changes after Mark is gone. Mark also has an aversion to technology so implementing these changes will be a challenge. These innovations will include, paperless filing, server and backup drive, E-filing, alternate forms of communication, and many more. What Mark lacks in technological skills, he makes up for with his professionalism, experience, and attention to detail. We are the only two in the office and we rely on each others strengths. This makes us a great team and we both are learning in the process. My presentation board includes excerpts from my Business Internship Mid-Term for Dr. Stading at TAMUT.

 A recent study has shown that veterans are 15 percent more likely to encounter food insecurities compared to civilians (Grossfield, 2015). With the assistance of Meals on Wheels, a nationwide agency that provides nutritional assistance, researchers surveyed 75 participants using a convenience sampling method. The survey tool used is a mixed methodological study with an emphasis on qualitative data. The most basic need for humans includes physiological fulfillment in order to grow physically, emotionally, and psychologically (Maslow, 1954). A veteran must satisfy the need for food in order to be motivated to advance ones wellbeing. In order for veterans to maintain being productive members of society food insecurities must be satisfied before higher levels of growth can be addressed. The researcher's hypotheses focuses on the age of veterans with food insecurities, and their comfortability and knowledge involving food assistance programs. The results of this study will reveal the percentages of the veteran population who are affected by food insecurity. The study educates the applicable agencies on the severity of this issue. Increasing knowledge of the issue of veteran food insecurity improves the dignity and worth of each person by promoting access to resources to satisfy their basic needs.<br>

 The microbes that live within animal intestines participate in a multitude of important functions such as digestion, excluding pathogens, and the generation of vitamins/amino acid precursors. While intestinal microbe populations are generally conserved between animals of the same species, the population is variable and sensitive to the host's diet, geographic location, and immune system. Current work has provided numerous insights into this dynamic population, but often relies on comparisons within a single species, or between numerous distantly related species. Throughout this study we will be looking at four species from the order <i>Rodentia</i> that inhabit the same environment. We hypothesize that the microbes found in each species will be unique to the species in question considering the variability in foraging methods as well as diet preferences of species occupying similar environmental ecological niches. Here we report our preliminary efforts to collect target animals and begin to quantify their morphometric and microbiologic differences<br>

 In a collaborative effort with education students, we have assessed the impact of literacy interventions in a Spanish speaking population living in the United States. We translated and then verbally administered a number of surveys that measure the impact on learning opportunities on how hope for the future has affected participants before and after literacy intervention. The use of a pretest/ posttest design enabled evaluation of the intervention. Our assessment is critical because it will help educators and researchers improve training programs to better benefit people around the world with limited access to formal education. There are many women who do not have hope for their future due to the fact that they lack literacy skills required to find a successful job. To understand how living conditions and opportunities influence the effect of literacy intervention, we will compare the impact of the same literacy program in the United States and the Dominican Republic. We expect to find similarities in data gathered in the United States and the Dominican Republic, since both populations have minority individuals living in border regions who share language barriers. Many Spanish minorities who live in the United States migrate from Mexico, which complicates access to education and career opportunities in English. The Haitian population in the Dominican Republic is in a similar situation because they have migrated to the Dominican Republic without knowing the languages necessary for attaining a job. Comparing these populations will provide us with feedback regarding the feasibility of conducting successful literacy interventions and assessments in the field.

 Many chemical and petrochemical industries discharge large amounts of wastewater into the environment without thinking of the danger it presents. Common compounds found in wastewater include organic pollutants such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX), which are very toxic to the well-being of humans as well as the environment. Certain treatment processes are required to minimize the contaminant levels of the volatile organic compounds to ensure the safety of the community when the wastewater is discharged.<br>
<br>
 The following work investigates a simulation of a common wastewater treatment technique known as adsorption to separate and purify the organic compounds from water, so that well-being of the community can be certain. Adsorption isotherms such as the Freundlich equation, as well as the initial BTEX concentration were studied by using a computer modeling software Aspen Chromatography. Once the simulation is complete, the data from Aspen was imported to Microsoft Excel to focus on the concept of breakthrough curves as well as the clean-up objective for each component. Another aspect which is studied is how the amount of granular activated carbon (GAC) affects the amount of time at which the breakthrough curves go above the clean-up levels. With this information, the data can help identify when the activated carbon is spent when subjected to a multicomponent mixture and different clean-up objectives with each different process. Also, in rotation of the lead and lag bed, the time at which the bed will become exhausted can be predicted in order to replace one bed and refill its activated carbon with fresh adsorbent. <br>

Sulfate is a primary anionic constituent of groundwater and surface water and is usually present in low concentrations. However, elevated sulfate levels, especially if combined with high calcium concentrations, can cause severe scaling in water fixtures. Furthermore, sulfate can be a problem in drinking water at concentrations &gt;250 mg/L (2.6 mM), the recommended secondary standard, at which level it can have a laxative effect. Naturally occurring sulfate in Texas groundwater is primarily derived from gypsum and anhydrite rocks which are common, especially in the western half of the state. Sulfate levels were measured in groundwater samples from several wells in west Texas utilizing three different techniques – the Hach SulfaVer Method, an experimental conductometric titration method, and ion chromatography. The results from all three methods were then compared.

The effects of gender stereotypes were investigated using an eye-tracking paradigm. Participants read experimental sentences containing gender-biased nouns (ASTRONAUT/NANNY) that acted as antecedents to gender specific pronouns (HE/SHE). Pronouns were manipulated to either match or mismatch their antecedents. In this reading experiment, eye movements were measured for each sentence. Sentences were divided into the following regions of interest (ROI): Definite article and antecedent (noun), verb (simple past tense), pre-critical (conjunction word), pronoun (HE/SHE), spillover, and final region (e.g., The DOCTOR | examined | the medication, | and | SHE | realized | that one was prescribed). Eye movements were recorded for duration of fixation times (i.e., time spent on antecedent, pronoun, spillover word), sum of reading times (i.e., time spent on ROI), and number of regressions (i.e., eye movements going opposite direction of text). It was predicted that readers would fixate longer on unexpected pronouns that mismatched their gender-role schema. We expected longer reading times in mismatched conditions (female typical role – male pronoun; male typical role – female pronoun) because of the predicted increase number of regressions and longer pronoun region fixation times. We included Spanish-English bilinguals to further investigate the effects of the first language (L1) and second language (L2) in the comprehension of stereotypes, especially for Spanish-English bilinguals whose L1 is Spanish—a language that is grammatically marked in gender (e.g., EL: masculine; LA: feminine). We systematically compare the results from the eye movements between bilinguals who are more dominant in L1 or L2, or equally dominant (balanced) in both languages. The predicted outcome of the eye movement data is expected to be more prominent in bilinguals with Spanish as L1 than English as the L1 or balanced bilinguals.

 <strong>Abstract</strong><br>
<br>
 As fossil fuel levels are declining more research is being conducted into alternative fuel sources. A promising alternative involves converting the lipids produced by microalgae into biodiesel. Crops high in lipid content are the current feedstock used for producing biodiesel, however the economical soundness of using a potential food source as a source of energy has been up for discussion. Microalgae are a potential alternative as they have higher lipid content and grow faster than crops. Microalgae also have a higher carbon dioxide fixation rate, which makes them environmentally friendly as they can be used to clear pollution in the atmosphere. Obtaining a large enough biomass of microalgae for production of biodiesel is currently a process that requires research. This study aims to determine how carbon, nitrogen, and light variation affect the biomass production and lipid content of the microalgae <i>Neochloris conjuncta</i>. By specifying the carbon concentration, nitrogen concentration, and light/dark cycle that optimizes the growth of <i>N. conjuncta</i> this not only would aid in the cost reduction of microalgae propagation and thus biodiesel production, but also will allow further research to be done on the potential of <i>N. conjuncta</i> as a possible species for use in large scale of biodiesel production.<br>

 Approximately 30 to 50% of colorectal cancers contain KRas mutations, which confer resistance to standard therapy and have therefore been termed “undruggable.” Since no curative treatments for KRas driven colon cancer are available, there is a critical need to develop toxicologically innocuous KRas therapeutic approaches that are free of safety problems intrinsic to drugs administered over long periods of time. <br>
<br>
 High fidelity signaling of Ras is dependent on its spatial organization into defined nanoclusters<b> </b>on the plasma membrane. This is noteworthy, because select nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, through direct modulation of the biophysical properties of the plasma membrane, alter oncogenic Ras nanoclustering and attenuate signal transduction. These findings suggest that Ras nanoclusters represent a novel target for future interventions. Consistent with this rationale, we hypothesize that select amphiphilic membrane targeted dietary bioactives (MTDB's), e.g., polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6Δ4,7,10,13,16,19) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5Δ5,8,11,14,17), [1] modulate the rigidity of the plasma membrane, [2] modify Ras nanocluster formation, [3] disrupt oncogenic Ras driven signaling (pERK), and [4] suppress phenotype (hyper-proliferation) <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>.<br>
<br>
 Our studies utilized a variety of complementary models including mouse colonic crypts, <i>Drosophila</i> midguts, and isogenic human and mouse colonic cell lines. Using a membrane order sensitive dye, Di-4-ANEPPDHQ, we initially characterized the rigidity of the plasma membrane in mouse colonic crypts and young adult mouse colonocytes (YAMC) cells. Quantification of Ras nanocluster formation was determined by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) combined with fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of fluorescently tagged Ras membrane targeting domains. In addition, oncogenic Ras driven signaling (pERK) and phenotype (hyper-proliferation) was determined by targeting expression of RasV12 or KRasG12D to <i>Drosophila</i> midgut stem cells and mouse colon, respectively. <br>
<br>
 <i>In vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> incorporation of n-3 PUFA consistently reduced plasma membrane rigidity and tH-Ras clustering, while increasing tK-Ras clustering and the mixing of tH and tK proteins. These changes in membrane spatiotemporal organization were associated with a reduction in oncogenic RasV12 driven ERK phosphorylation and intestinal stem cell proliferation.<br>
<br>
 These novel findings demonstrate a unique role for MTDBs in the modulation of Ras nanoscale spatial organization and signaling. Establishing a role for MTDBs in Ras-dependent oncogenesis would have a major translational impact because these bioactives are safe, well tolerated, relatively inexpensive, and provide additional health benefits, such as reduction in mortality.<br>

 As the public sector becomes more sophisticated, critical questions are asked and stringent limitations placed on institutions of higher education. These concerns appear at a time of a decline in college enrollment, conflict between racial and ethnic groups, and a continuous debate on the core curriculum to develop quality education. Many Scholars have been researching how diverse discourse could not only close the learning and achievement gap; but, also how the practices interact with voice, and identity, as well as socioeconomic, and political components. If educators begin to understand other people's use of English, they will demonstrate twenty-first century pedagogy or millennium pedagogy for reaching all students. Limited research has been conducted in higher education on diverse discourse within the college classroom. In this study, a descriptive research method will be employed to explore Historical Black Colleges and Universities' professors' perceptions on diverse discourse. A mixed method research design will be used to complete this research. The quantitative research will be gathered using a self-report survey administered through Qualtrics. Qualitative research will be gathered from faculty who agree to a follow-up interview (on the Consent form), and they will be contacted via telephone. The professors will be surveyed and interviewed during the fall of 2017. The results of this study will be significant in understanding the vernacular discourse and establishing a knowledge base for diverse discourse in the college level courses.<b></b><br>

Frailty and sarcopenia are risks associated with functional decline of aging. Longevity research is now focused on extending health span for individuals, the period of time that aging adults are free of chronic diseases such as these. A possible intervention that may increase health span is the drug rapamycin which has been found to significantly increase life span in mice. In order to determine whether rapamycin may increase health, locomotion and balance are being examined in marmosets (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>), a New World primate. Marmosets are a good model for aging studies due to their short average lifespan of four to six years. To test whether rapamycin protects aging marmosets from functional decline in locomotion and balance, we examined ambulation of the marmosets in an open field. Twenty marmosets have been receiving daily doses of oral rapamycin in a yogurt vehicle for over one year. The open field apparatus measured six foot by six foot, gridded by one foot marks, enclosed along the exterior with a two-foot barrier. Marmosets were trained to transfer into a cylinder from their cage and then into a ferret ball. For the trial the ferret ball was placed into the open field and data collection included location within the field each 20 seconds, and number of grid line crossings collected instantaneously. In the preliminary two minute trials marmosets regardless of age and rapamycin status varied between very active and inactive. In the lengthened four minute trials half of the marmosets doubled in line crossing, as well as varying in position and balance inside the ball itself. Trials continue to increase in time to the full 10 minute trials in which speed, balance, and distance traveled will be analyzed from video recordings. <br>

 Galvanization is a commonly used corrosion protection method for steel parts. The most productive is the hot-dip processes, where the part is dipped in a bath of molten zinc. During the process of galvanization, the surface of the metal parts may not be uniformly coated. Excess aluminum in the galvanization kettle, sand embedded in castings, welding slag, and other processing malfunctions can cause defective galvanized parts with too thick or thin layers of zinc on galvanized surfaces. Detecting defects reliably and accurately on galvanized metals non-destructively is more cost effective and can prevent future hazards. Knowing the defective areas of the parts will also be helpful when repairing the part.<br>
<br>
 The purpose of this study is to investigate the rate of heat loss when heated galvanized steel parts are removed from an oven after being heated at 200° Fahrenheit and brought to room temperature. We expect that defects will demonstrate identifiable differences in their heat loss profiles compared to the defect-free parts. The heated parts are imaged using a FLIR thermal camera at 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 seconds, followed by 2, 3, 4, 5, 20, 40, 60 minutes after being removed from the oven. Different points in the image are selected, and the temperature is recorded at the same points across all images. Then, the gradient of each plot is investigated. Areas with thinner zinc coating have shown faster rate of heat loss than areas with thicker coating. The next step is to identify location of defects independently, and correlate temperature gradients within and across images, for automated defect prediction.<br>

 Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disease which develops after exposure to a traumatic event. To advance in PTSD therapy, it is critical to gain a better understanding of molecular mechanisms of PTSD, however current animal models are unamenable for PTSD studies. Since ~70 percent of the protein-coding genes in humans have at least an orthologue zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>), we hypothesized that zebrafish can develop PTSD. This hypothesis was tested by subjecting zebrafish to trauma and comparing the behaviors of traumatized and non-traumatized fish at 24 hrs and 3 weeks after the trauma. Zebrafish subjected to the trauma were non-social and spend 7000-fold less time interacting with its tank mates. Traumatized fish also developed avoidance symptoms and interacted 580-fold less time with the object used for inducing trauma. To identify genes and pathways involved in PTSD development, RNA from control and traumatized zebrafish brains were subjected to Illumina Next-generation sequencing (NGS). In traumatized fish 225 genes (131 genes upregulated and 94 genes downregulated) had two fold or more changes in expression. Additionally, network analysis using Enrichr identified 12 stress related pathways in traumatized fish. In summary, we established a zebrafish model for PTSD and identified gene networks altered in PTSD fish brain.<br>

 Using a nationally representative data set, I examine the relationship among cultural assimilation, attitude toward recycling, and suicidality among Mexican Americans. Inspired by the theoretical implications of Gordon's (1964) traditional assimilation theory, I test the hypothesis that immigrants who assimilate well to mainstream American society hold unfavorable attitudes towards recycling, and that unfavorable attitude toward recycling is indicative of a mindset that does not value life, which would translate to increased likelihood for suicidal thoughts and for suicidal behavior. To test this train of hypotheses, I use a series of regression models with suicide thoughts and behaviors as dependent variables, attitude toward recycling as mediating variable, and immigrants' degree of assimilation as my focal independent variable. My findings have implications on our understanding assimilation dynamics, and advances our knowledge base on suicidality. <br>

 Abstract 
</strong>– “Energy Storage System (ESS) is a key solution for the integration of renewable energy resources (RES) into the electric grid. The ESS provides the needed flexibility to balance the net load variability and serves as a buffer for RES uncertainty. Microgrids offer significant benefits to the power system and have also contributed to the growth and increased penetration of RES. A microgrid is a small-scale power system which could operate in grid-connected or Islanded mode. Islanding events of microgrids requires an uninterrupted supply to meet the load demand as such the microgrid coordinates the RES, ESS, Distributed Generators (DG) and Demand management to ensure a reliable power system in a standalone microgrid.<br>
<br>
 In this research, we will propose an optimization technique to optimally size and schedule a utility-scale Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) for a microgrid unit commitment problem. The microgrid under consideration will consists of DGs, a high penetration level of wind power generation and a combination of fixed and flexible loads. The main contribution would be to obtain the optimal size of a BESS that will produce the minimum cost and accommodates all amounts of net load fluctuations over a seasonal and intra seasonal time horizon.""

The Henry Ford Assembly line in 1913 set the trailblazing initiative to manufacture products at a large rate in an efficient manner. Manufacturing contributes to the advancement of multiple economies. The top three leading manufactures come from China, Japan, and the United States respectively. This is a result from mass producing appliances, automotive, and, other needs. Consider how vital the industrial manufacturing aspect of economy is. Technology is consistently developing, and is threatened by individuals who desire to exploit vulnerabilities within manufacturing for various reasons ranging from generating wealth to personal vendettas. Attention to the risks of cyber-attacks have grown over time since the damage has been recorded to be at record high numbers of the last few decades. Cyber-attacks have cost industries trillions of dollars as a report from the 2010 census. Industrial Manufacturing will continue to thrive into the future and, as a result the measures taken to protect the business of Industrial Manufacturing will improve as well.

 Seasonal and sub-seasonal streamflow forecasts, developed using climate-based forecasts, can be valuable in planning and management of water resources for meeting municipal and industrial water demands, scheduling agricultural operations, optimizing hydropower generation, and creating emergency plans for drought mitigation. However, the forecasting skill of monthly to seasonal streamflow forecasts varies between different seasons as well as over different geographical locations. Therefore, the objectives of this study are: a) Develop monthly updated retrospective streamflow forecasts for multiple River basins using climate forecasts information and evaluate the predictability skill during different seasons, and b) Reduce uncertainty in developed streamflow forecasts by multimodel combinations.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
 The Principal Component Regression (PCR) modeling is used to develop monthly updated streamflow forecasts using the International Research Institute of Climate and Society (IRI)'s Climate Predictability Tool (CPT). For each month, different PCR models are developed utilizing precipitation and air temperature forecasts from the ECHAM4.5 General Circulation Model (GCM) and Coupled Forecast System Model Version 2 (CFSv2) as well as previous month's streamflow as predictors.The model is calibrated using the data from 1958 to 1985 for each month and the retrospective streamflow forecasts are developed over the 1986 to 2015 time period for the lead time of 1 to 7 months. The Spearman rank correlation and the Mean Square Skill Score (MSSS) are used to compare the performance of the developed forecasts with respect to the observed streamflow. The streamflow forecasts using ECHAM4.5 and CFSv2 models will be combined in order to reduce the uncertainty in forecasts. The streamflow forecasts will also be developed using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) land surface model to quantify the improvements in forecasting skills over statistical based streamflow forecasts. <br>

<br>
 The philosophical predispositions of the Fathers of the American Revolution are perpetually under the scrutiny of those who followed. It cannot be denied, however, that a significant portion of these men were guided by period principles inherited from the Enlightenment and their Puritan ancestors. The American Revolution was certainly a war for thinking men. Though upon the first outbreak of violence, thinking men were required to set in place vital elements of waging war, including the institutions of espionage and military intelligence. Individuals who found themselves as spies, however, were often denigrated within the military and society. Historians have often examined the development of espionage as a craft, studying methods, like cyphers, dead drops, and invisible ink, and the effects this craft had on the outcome of the American Revolution. Other historians have studied influential characters, like John Andre and Nathan Hale, who helped shape espionage in the Revolution. Few have examined the motivations of spies and the stigmas that inevitably followed them. Within the intersection of Puritan and Enlightenment ideals which condemned espionage as an affront to honor, these spies could reconcile themselves through Puritan ideals of “calling” and “common good.” Espionage, not being exclusive to free white men, also provided women and slaves opportunity to leave their own mark on the Revolution and to win the honor they were so often denied. <br>

 Children are to be placed in the least restrictive environment possible, which is currently perceived to be family based care rather than children's homes. Currently, children's homes are labeled as congregate care along with psychiatric institutions, residential treatment facilities, and emergency shelters. However, children's homes are seen as a “last resort"" choice when trying to place children. This quantitative study assesses the perception between children's homes and family based foster homes when considering the placement of a child. A total of 50 participants are surveyed using convenience and purposive sampling. Researchers use a multi-method survey approach, which includes 22 pre-developed true/false, open-ended, and demographic questions. The Systems Perspective describes multiple entities working together to support a whole structure. When placing a child, there are various child-based agencies collaborating to ensure the betterment of the child. The hypotheses center on positive and negative perceptions, and the professionals' understanding about children's homes, specifically Child Protective Services. Results suggest, child placement professionals need to be educated on the different levels of care such as family care institutions and congregate care in order to effectively place a child in the most least restrictive setting.

 Scientific research supports the benefits of animal assisted therapy for people with conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and autism spectrum disorder. Most of these studies consider only canines or equines as therapy animals; however, recent studies have considered chickens as effective therapy animals. The HENPOWER organization created a program in England that focused on caring for elderly patients with Alzheimer's disease and dementia. HENPOWER utilized chickens within a curriculum based on medical and animal assisted therapy. Research assessing the program showed that both men and women developed strong emotional bonds with the chickens, and they also became more social, emotionally stable, and experienced improved overall health (Cook et al., 2013). <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
 Many U.S. psychologists have yet to explore using chickens as therapy animals, so the goal of this study was to evaluate perceptions of chickens and their ability to serve as therapy animals. Because chickens are uncommonly used as therapy animals, it was predicted that people would view them as incapable and incompetent animals. However, after viewing educational video clips regarding the ability of chickens, both chicken owners and non-owners were expected to view chickens as more competent and capable.<br>
<br>
 Chicken owners (<i>n</i> = 21) and non-owners (<i>n</i> = 16) provided their perceptions of chickens before and after they viewed two video clips demonstrating clicker training and use as therapy animals overseas. After watching the videos, mixed model analysis of variance indicated significant differences in perceptions of chickens with decreases in perceptions of chickens being useful only for food purposes and increases in perceptions of chickens' intelligence and ability to provide companionship. In addition, non-owners reported significantly larger increases in agreement that chickens can serve as therapy animals than owners. The results may reveal new opportunities to consider chickens as economical, practical alternatives for therapy animals.<br>

 Data visualization is the graphical display of abstract information, often serving two purposes: sense-making and communication (Card, Mackinlay, &amp; Shneiderman, 1999). Research has shown that data visualization is a powerful means to discovery, understanding, and communicating about the important stories that live in our data (Armitage, 2016). This presentation focuses on using data dashboards to report information on student enrollment and degrees awarded at Texas A&amp;M University-Commerce. The department of Institutional Effectiveness and Research focusses on delivering efficient and effective data-driven outputs to university administrators to enable evidence-based decision making. Historically, data reports have been in a static format with limited information delivered. For example, when using an Excel spreadsheet, it may consist of multiple tabs in a single spreadsheet to convey the desired amount of information. WebFOCUS Dynamic Dashboard (WFDD) enables users to display large quantities of information on the same page through the use of interactive and user-customizable reports. The WFDD allows the user to select multiple levels of parameters to produce varied results of data output. Using dashboards simplifies the presentation of reports, and also delivers more robust information. Furthermore, data visualization graphical displays such as pie-charts, bar graphs, and tabular reports assist in intuitive understanding of the data. We will demonstrate the dynamic qualities of data dashboards compared to traditional, static format of traditional reports. Supporting the findings of past research, this presentation demonstrates the powerful influence of data visualization. <br>

Wetlands are critical habitats for a wide variety of taxa. However, they are in peril as 52% of Texas wetlands have been drained, dredged, filled, or flooded. In response, many conservation agencies have made efforts to create artificial wetland complexes, but because over 95% of the land in Texas is privately owned, large parcels of land with the potential to be reconstructed into wetlands are a rarity in the open market. Smaller plots of land may be more available to convert to wetlands, but little is known about how much biodiversity they can support in comparison to larger artificial wetlands. We used drift fencing combined with funnel traps and pitfall traps to measure the herpetological communities at two artificial wetland complexes that drastically varied in size: (1) the Texas A&amp;M University Commerce artificial wetlands; and (2) the Cooper Lake WMA. To compare communities, we used total abundance, species richness, Simpson's Diversity Index, Simpson's Diversity Index reciprocal, Shannon-Weiner Diversity Index, Brillouin Diversity Index, Simpson's Evenness, Camargo Evenness, Smith and Wilson Evenness, and Nee <i>et al</i>. Evenness. We found that the smaller wetland complex had greater outputs in all of the measures of diversity and equitability, had greater total abundance, and had just as much species diversity as the larger artificial wetland. Future wetland conservationists should utilize smaller areas that can be transformed into wetland habitat as these areas can support large amounts of biodiversity and healthy communities. <br>",

 Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) are adverse side effects experienced by approximately 75 million patients each year. The physical complications and institutional costs associated with PONV negatively impact patients' postoperative outcomes and hospital costs. This integrative systematic literature review was conducted to assess the effectiveness of aromatherapy (AR) on the severity of PONV in adult postoperative patients in comparison to those who did not receive this alternative therapy. <b> </b>An examination of English written literature was conducted in the databases: CINAHL, PubMed, and Science Direct. Studies were included if published between 2009-2015 and focused on the application of AR as a treatment modality for adult patients experiencing PONV. The research evaluated how effective AR, isopropyl alcohol, and controlled breathing were on reducing the severity of PONV in adult patients. Narrowed<b> </b>down from 693 research samples, the final sample included five randomized controlled trials (RCT) and one quasi-experimental study, all conducted in the United States. Four out of six studies supported the effectiveness of AR in decreasing the severity of PONV in adult patients. One study did not reveal a significant decrease in PONV when AR was used when compared to patients who used controlled breathing. The sixth study did not show a significant decrease in PONV with AR, but found potential for AR as a useful adjunctive therapy. AR is potentially an effective and economical treatment option for PONV. Larger sample sizes, consistent AR blends and methodologies, standard measuring tools, and multi-site studies are necessary to determine if AR is a dependable, and preferred treatment option. <br>

 Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) leads to metastasis of breast cancer cells. Current studies from our laboratory suggested that G1P3-induced E-cadherin endocytosis augments breast cancer metastasis. Since E-cadherin mediated cell-cell adhesion is augmented by b-catenin, , and increased b-catenin levels are associated with cell migration, we hypothesized that G1P3-induced E-cadherin endocytosis alters b-catenin expression and localization to promote cancer cell metastasis. To test this hypothesis, expression of b-catenin in vector control (MCF-7Vector) and in G1P3 expressing cells (MCF-7G1P3) cells were compared. Western blot analyses showed identified that there was slightly lessa marked reduction of b-catenin levels in MCF-7G1P3 than in MCF-7Vector cells(Figure 1). Additionally, an anti-actin blot revealed that there was fairly consistent loading for each sample (Figure 2). These b-catenin expression levels were further validated using confocal imaging studies. In summary, our results suggest that the decreased levels of beta-catenin in MCF-7G1P3 cells are associated with G1P3 mediated E-cadherin endocytosis and increased cell migration.

 In the realm of exercise science related to the golfer, research is rather new to the race. It is only recently that golfers are working strength and conditioning into their training regimens. Strength and conditioning training for the golfer is necessary to not only enhance performance but to delay fatigue during long rounds as well as prevent injury to the athlete. Researching how to physically prepare the golf athlete in the most biomechanically functional way will allow the golfer to train their bodies to perform most efficiently. Plyometric rotational power training is one of the closest ways to replicate exercise for the musculature involved during the actual golf swing. If we can assess the results and benefits of training competitive golfers through this mode, then we can travel closer to establishing the ideal training regimen to keep golfers healthy and their scores consistently low. The investigator believes golfers that partake in rotational power training will have increased golf performance. Eight female collegiate golfers will participate in a nine week rotational power exercise protocol. Baseline measurements such as trunk flexibility, rotational velocity, core strength, club head speed and driving distance will be obtained and retaken at the conclusion of the nine week period to determine any significant improvements in these golf performance components.<br>

Whether it is first graders participating in club basketball or adults playing city league volleyball, sports are occurring year-round in today's society and we are always searching for methods to improve our performance. The purpose of this study was to follow up on a previous study conducted by two undergraduate students out of Drake University who analyzed maximum vertical jump height after two miles of running on collegiate-aged female participants. We substituted male participants for female participants to test if improvements in overall jump heights are gender exclusive or not. In addition, we added an additional one mile running distance trial to test to see if a statistically significant improvement can be seen in maximum vertical jump height performance at a shorter distance of running. Ten collegiate-aged male participants participated in the study. In conducting the research we used a Vertec and Just Jump (JJ) contact mat to collect vertical height data (5 jumps) (pre-running). We then had participants run on the treadmill for one mile during one testing session and two miles at the second testing session. Immediately after completion of the run, participants performed another 5 jumps. In conclusion, there was a statistical significant increase in maximal vertical jump height between the pre and post jumps of the Vertec (<i>p</i>=0.018) and the Just Jump mat (<i>p</i>=0.0002) after the one-mile run was observed. These results could alter the pre competition warm up implemented by coaches and trainers to prepare their athletes for a variety of sporting events and increase their teams performance.<br>

<br>
 At least three major comprehensive literature reviews of citizens' perceptions, interactions, attitudes, and trust towards law enforcement officers have been conducted (Decker (1985), Brown &amp; Benedict (2002) and Peck (2015)). A consistent research finding is that racial and ethnic minorities hold less positive attitudes and have less positive interactions with the police than Whites. Little research attention has been paid to the attitudes and opinions that police officers hold towards minority citizens, young citizens in particular. This paper will analyze the TAPS Academy police officers' perception of their role while interacting with at-risk youth in three different juvenile facilities (an alternative school, a minimum and a maximum security facility). Data was collected from 13 officers who participated in the program. It is assumed that there are differences in their role perception based on the facilities they serve. Officers were given a pre-test the first week of their program and a post-test after 10 weeks of participation. The findings will provide an understanding on the type of officer's characteristics, attitudes, and role perception as they interacted with these youths.<br>

 <strong>ABSTRACT </strong></b><br>
 This project helps us in understanding resource matching issues in cloud computing field recommends resource. This resource recommendation method can regulate multi-attribute matching between provider solutions and customer demands. It integrates the price utility, multi-attribute matching metric and group customer evaluation. This can be proved by various stimulated scenarios. The results are of high significance to design an effective resource matching and recommendation with guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. However, recent studies have revealed that the network elements consume 10–20% of the total power in the data center, which poses a great challenge to effectively reducing network power cost without adversely affecting overall network performance. Based on the analysis on topology characteristics and traffic patterns of data centers, this paper presents a novel approach, called Planner, for network power reduction in the virtualization-based data centers. The basic idea of Planner is to optimize both virtual machine placement and traffic flow routing so as to turn off as many unneeded network elements as possible for power saving. Parameters like makespan,latency and load balancing are considered in the QoS-driven scheduling algorithm but Minimizing of the total cost is also an important issue. This paper also discuss about the cost of the QoS-driven task.<br>

 Abstract</strong><br>
<br>
 This project investigated the interactions between metal cofactors and various amino acids that were formed as metal complexes. The first approach to create these transition metal complexes is by mixing an amino acid and different transitional metals in water. In this investigation, the amino acid used was histidine and the transition metal used was nickel, copper (II), and iron (II). As shown in UV-vis, IR, NMR, and X-ray diffractions, this procedure failed to form a metal-histidine complex. With further research, the second approach is to use sodium carbonate solution to help the metal ions to form a complex. To further advance the understanding of such interactions between the metal cofactor and amino acids, the project employed computational modeling using density functional theory (DFT) and ZINDO to predict the UV-Vis spectrum of these complexes. The complexes were building on Linux operating system and Gaussian View. Because there are three nitrogen atoms and one oxygen atoms that can be used to bind the metal, different binding modes between the nickel and histidine were also explored. In fact, Nickel-complexes can bind either square planar or tetrahedral geometry, regardless the initial geometry. Examining the LUMO and HUMO orbitals further helped to understand different electronic structure due to the different metal cofactors, especially the d-orbital of metal and valence orbitals of amino acids. <br>

 <b>Abstract</b><br>
<br>
 Analysis of urine is an essential tool for monitoring liver and kidney function, and is a valuable asset in the diagnosis and evaluation of many disease states, including diabetes and renal failure. However, biological fluids, such as urine, are complex mixtures which contain a large variety of potentially interfering substances, which complicate the analysis of sulfate by many methods. Our laboratory has previously successfully measured sulfate levels in a series of artificial urines prepared containing known concentrations of sodium chloride, potassium sulfate, glucose, and albumin using a conductometric titration technique. The domestic pig has proven to be a useful model for study of many human disease states, and pigs are large enough to provide adequate volumes of urine for analysis. Therefore, this method has now been utilized to measure sulfate levels in the urine of a group of mixed breed domestic pigs. <br>

 <b>Methods and Materials</b><br>
<br>
 The basic analytical procedure involves titration of aqueous sulfate containing samples with a standardized barium chloride solution and monitoring the conductivity of the solution using hand-held conductivity meter and has been previously described. (1) Results were analyzed using graphical methods. All chemicals were ACS Reagent Grade. Urine samples were collected by an undergraduate Animal Sciences student and refrigerated until analysis. No prior sample treatment was required. Sample volumes used for analysis were 25.00 mL.<br>
<br>
 <b>Results and Discussion</b><br>
<br>
 No experimental difficulties which required special handling were experienced during the urine titration process. A sample titration curve is shown in Figure 1 below. The data has been corrected for dilution. The end point of the titration is the intersection of the two trendlines.<br>

 Table 1. Pig urine sulfate concentrations in mmol/L.<br>
<br>
 Urine composition is variable depending on collection time, hydration, and other factors. Therefore, reference values are usually based upon 24 hour excretion rather than random samples. We were unable to locate reference values for pigs, but a reference value for human urine is 7-47 mmol/24 hours (Mayo Clinic). A reference for urine volume for pigs is 5-30 mL/kg body weight/day (Merck Veterinary Manual, online edition). Therefore, a 24 hour urine volume for a 150 kg pig might range from 750 mL to 4.5 L, and the sulfate concentration (based on human values) could range from a theoretical minimum of 1.5 mM to a theoretical maximum of 62 mM. However, an average concentration of around 12 mM seems reasonable. Based upon these assumptions, sulfate levels in the older sows, both treated and untreated, were within a normal range. Three younger sows – two controls and one treatment - were abnormally high. <br>
<br>
 <b>Conclusion</b><br>
<br>
 Analysis of pig urine sulfate levels by conductometric titration presented no operational difficulties and yielded reasonable results. Results indicated no difference in urinary sulfate levels between controls and pigs fed gossypol in pigs older than 2 years. However, some of the younger sows (approximately one year old) included in the study did show elevated sulfate levels, but correlation with treatment is unclear. Current plans are to repeat measurements on the elevated individuals to see if a cause can be identified. We also are attempting to obtain an ion chromatograph to validate our results using a certified technique.<br>

 The total cost of inpatient care from a traumatic mechanism of injury in the United States between 2001 and 2011 was $240.7 billion. Medical resident work hour reductions mandated in 2011, left a shortage of available in-hospital providers to care for trauma patients. This created gaps in continuity of care which can lead to costly increased lengths of stay (LOS) and increased medical errors. Adding advanced practice nurses (APN) specializing in acute or trauma care to the trauma team may help fill this shortage in trauma care providers. The purpose of this integrative systematic review of the literature was to determine if adding APN's to the admitting trauma team would decrease length of stay. A systematic review of primary research in CINAHL and PubMed databases was performed using the terms: nurse practitioner, advanced practice nurse, trauma team, and length of stay. Included studies examined the effects of adding APNs to trauma teams, were written in English and published 2007-2017. Six studies were included in the final sample and all were completed at Level I trauma centers in the United States except one from Canada. Combined sample size was 25,083 admitted trauma patients. All six studies reported a decrease in LOS ranging from 0.8 days to 2.54 days when APNs were added to the trauma team. More research is needed to identify the best utilization of an APN on a trauma team. It is recommended all trauma centers, add APNs to the trauma team not only to decrease admitted trauma patients' LOS but to also provide continuity of care, decreasing costs and minimizing errors. <br>

 The Dark Triad of personality includes three socially aversive traits: Machiavellianism, narcissism and psychopathy. The dark traits have been associated with behavior such as deception, manipulation, and exploitation, behaviors not often associated with parenting or the motivation to parent. While some past research has examined how parenting styles might predict development of the dark traits, little or no research has explored how the dark traits may predict future parenting styles. Through an anonymous online survey, this research investigated how the Dark Triad of personality relates to perceived future parenting styles of non-parents. Participants completed the <i>Dark Triad-Short Form</i> (SD3; Jones &amp; Paulhus, 2014) and the <i>Parenting Styles Dimensions Questionnaire</i> (PSDQ; Robinson, 1995), reworded to reflect how participants think they would be as future parents. It was predicted that participants who score high on the Dark Triad of personality would anticipate higher authoritarian and permissive parenting styles in the future, while an inverse relationship was predicted between the Dark Triad traits and future authoritative parenting. Using multiple regression, SD3 scores were entered as predictors of prospective PSDQ scores. Results showed that psychopathy significantly predicted all future parenting styles, where higher psychopathy scores were associated with higher prospective authoritarian and permissive parenting scores, but lower prospective authoritative scores, as hypothesized. Machiavellianism scores did not significantly predict any of the anticipated parenting styles. Contrary to what was hypothesized, narcissism significantly predicted future authoritative parenting, where higher narcissism scores were related to higher prospective authoritative parenting scores. This study contributes to a growing body of literature on the relationship between personality and parenting practices. These findings may have implications for marriage and family therapy, where the Dark Triad traits can inform individuals' views about parenting and their parenting choices.<br>

 Access to a quality algebra course by 8th grade is positively linked with completion of higher-level mathematics courses, admission to college, and entry into STEM majors. Yet, only 8% of American students successfully complete algebra 1 by 9th grade. Fewer students from rural and urban districts demonstrated mastery in Pre-Calculus/Advanced Placement (AP) courses with 7% of low-income students demonstrating mastery of these courses. Therefore, it is important that interventions are in place to support all students' access to Algebra I. The purpose of this investigation was to synthesize the theoretical frameworks and areas of identified research needs used by mathematics education and special education. Qualitative meta-synthesis identifies strategies used and conditions under which they may be effective by using a dataset that would not otherwise be logistically feasible to collect. A systemic search of the literature published from 1974 to 2016 was completed. Search results yielded 69 articles and dissertations; 54 met quality and relevance criteria. Inclusion and quality inter-rater reliability were 100%. The majority of studies focused on algebra strategies, discussion, and group work. The majority of studies included an emotional support component. Findings suggest the need for many areas of additional inquiry to effectively meet the needs of algebra learners. This synthesis benefits practitioners in mathematics and special education because knowing how both fields communicate allows for wider dissemination of best practices, which can help align the goals mathematics educators and special educators to support students with diverse learning needs.<br>

<br>
 Tetracycline antibiotics have been used for over 50 years to effectively treat a wide variety of bacterial infections causing diseases ranging from acne to bacterial pneumonia. Tetracycline monooxygenase (TetX) is an enzyme shown to confer resistance to the antibiotic, tetracycline in several pathogenic bacteria. The recent emergence of tetracycline resistant pathogens threatens the continued usage within clinics and requires the development of newer treatment strategies. The focus of the research concerns the development and optimization of an expression protocol of TetX. The long-term goal of the studies, initiated this summer, is to design inhibitors of TetX to prevent the enzyme from degrading tetracycline. These inhibitors could be used with tetracycline to treat antibiotic resistant bacteria. For the proposed study to proceed, a protocol to obtain large quantities of active TetX needs to be developed. The pET22 (a+) plasmid containing the gene encoding TetX was used to transform competent <i>Escherichia coli (E. coli)</i> cells<i>.</i> The pET22 (a+) plasmid that was used contains the <i>lac </i>operon allowing for induction of protein expression by isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). To optimize the expression of TetX, Rosetta (DE3) pLysS and DH5α competent cell strains were used. Induction trials were carried out on both strains of competent cells at different induction temperatures and incubation periods. TetX production was monitored spectrophotometrically, through SDS PAGE, and polarographic assays of enzymatic activity. Based on the calculated specific activities of the cell extracts collected it was concluded that the optimal induction conditions were incubation of DH5α for 20 hours at 30 oC. These studies have paved the way for large scale expression purification of TetX, which will be required for detailed studies of its catalytic mechanism.<br>

 The Chronicle of Higher Education Almanac (2015) reports the results of their survey on 250 four-year institutions with African American women representing only 3.4 percent of all college presidents, 3.9 percent of chief academic officers and 7.9 percent senior administrative leaders. Research by the National Center for Educational Statistics (USDE, 2015) shows a steady growth of African American women earning their doctorate degrees at a rate of 7,096 graduates in 2010 to 8,811 graduates in 2015. The top executive leaders in higher education set the foundation for academic excellence, student services, innovation, community outreach and diversity initiatives. The lack of diversity and inclusion of African American women creates a missing piece of the puzzle of an organizational structure. The purpose of this quantitative study is to examine the possible relationship between the organizational qualifications and the perception of effective leadership of African American women as executive leaders. <br>
<br>
 Does the perception of effective leadership contribute to the lack of representation of African American women as executive leaders? Does social media portrays an image of African American women on reality television as their normal behavior. These questions will have answers after the data analysis phase of the research. According to Hannum, Muhly, Shockley-Zalabak, and White (2014) reports the lack of diversity at executive levels of higher education limits the success of institutions and bypasses the benefits of a diverse leadership team with African American women as executives. It appears that once an African American woman reaches a certain level, despite experience, education, or achievements, her career advancement opportunities ae diminished (Licea, 2013).Social learning, self-efficacy and symbolic interaction theories are the framework for this study. The instrument in this study will be an online survey of fifteen Likert-type questions to indicate level of agreement with Cronbach's Alpha to measure the consistency and reliability. <br>

 Rapid growth in electronic medical records use has expanded the availability of bio-medical history in electronic format. Named Entity Recognition on electronic medical records is a challenging task to mine medical knowledge from such a vast database for assisting medical diagnose making. Traditional named Entity Recognition techniques are constructed based on machine learning methods such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Maximum Entropy (ME), Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Conditional Random Fields (CRF). Recently deep neural network approaches become powerful methods for NER. In this study, we propose to use Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) RNN to recognize clinical entities in Chinese electronic medical records (CEMR) using word embedding. In the first step, we pre-processed the data and generated word embedding. Then we use the word embeddings model to train the model. The experimental results demonstrate Bi-directional LSTM RNN outperform the traditional approach.<br>",TBD

 G1P3, a target of immuno-endocrine signaling is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer. Recent studies from our group identified a role for G1P3-induced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) in breast cancer metastasis. Gene expression array and network analysis identified dysregulation of vesicle mediated endocytic pathway in G1P3 expressing cells (MCF-7G1P3). Plasma membrane localization of E-cadherin, a cell-to-cell adhesion molecule, is known to suppress cancer cell metastasis. Therefore, we hypothesized that increased endocytosis of E-cadherin by G1P3 induced mtROS promote cancer cell metastasis. Although E-cadherin protein levels were similar in MCF-7Vector and MCF-7G1P3 cells, confocal imaging studies identified altered membrane localization of E-cadherin in MCF-7G1P3 cells. In MCF-7Vector cells, E-cadherin was predominantly on plasma membrane, whereas in MCF-7G1P3 cells, E-cadherin was localized in cytosol and in endocytic vesicles. Subsequently, in subcellular fractionation studies, relative to MCF-7Vector cells, <br>
 E-cadherin levels were1.5-fold less in membrane fractions of MCF-7G1P3 cells with a 6.45-fold increase in cytosolic fractions (P≤0.05). Moreover, Caveolin-1, a major mediator of endocytosis was upregulated in MCF-7G1P3 cells in both quantitative RT-PCR (4.8-fold) and in immunoblotting (4.12-fold) analyses. Additionally, E-cadherin and Caveolin-1 was markedly colocalized in MCF-7G1P3 cells, indicating caveolae mediated endocytosis of E-Cadherin. Mito-TEMPO, a mitochondrial ROS scavenger, reversed G1P3's effects on E-cadherin endocytosis and increased its membrane localization. Similarly, Methyl-beta-cyclodextrin, a caveolin inhibitor, suppressed caveolin mediated endocytosis and restored E-cadherin membrane localization. Consequently, MitoTEMPO and MBDC independently reduced MCF-7 cell migration. In summary, our results demonstrate a novel mechanism of G1P3 induced metastasis by augmented caveolae mediated E-cadherin endocytosis rather than suppressing its expression. Interrupting G1P3 mediated E-cadherin endocytosis may prevent metastasis to improve clinical outcomes in breast cancer patients.<br>",TBD

Evapotranspiration is an important component of the hydrological cycle, and its accurate estimation is essential for agricultural water management. Estimated daily reference evapotranspiration (ETo) is used to determine the water requirement of crops using the crop factor method. The standardized American Society of Civil Engineers Penman-Monteith Equation (ASCE-ET) and Food and Agriculture Organization Penman-Monteith equation (FAO-ETo) use complete weather data to estimate ETo whereas many empirical methods based on radiation and temperature use limited climate data. The main objectives of this study were to (i) evaluate different empirical methods and (ii) calibrate parameters of empirical methods to estimate ETo in Northwest Texas using climate data from West Texas Mesonet (<a href=""http://www.mesonet.ttu.edu"">www.mesonet.ttu.edu</a>). Daily ETo calculated between 2006 and 2016 by FAO Penman-Monteith (FAO-ETo) equation using observed weather data was compared to ETo estimated by the following empirical methods: Hargreaves-Samani, Monthly Hargreaves-Samani, Valiantzas, Priestley-Taylor, Makkink and Stephens-Stewart. The required data to estimate FAO-ETo were collected for 48 weather stations from West Texas Mesonet. The coefficient of determination (R2), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Bias Error (MBE), Willmott index of agreement (d) and Ratio were used for the evaluation of the empirical equations. Results indicate that all selected methods underestimated ETo when original parameters were used. The R Package nlstools was used to derive calibrated parameters of empirical methods. Calibrated parameters improved ETo estimation; however, all methods underestimated ETo when FAO-ETo is in the range of 8 - 16 mm. Estimated ETo using Monthly Hargreaves and Samani equation with original and calibrated parameters were in good agreement with those estimated from FAO-ETo. This study identified the best empirical method to estimate ETo which can be used to estimate reference evapotranspiration using measured and forecasted daily maximum and minimum temperatures in Northwest Texas.<br>",TBD

 The diversity seen in classrooms all over the United States is increasing significantly. As this number increases, so does the need for globally competent educators that will effectively teach students from all backgrounds. The purpose of this review is to determine the impact that international service learning has on global competency in teacher candidates. This research provides a framework to support the inclusion of international service learning experiences, as well as specific examples of activities that could be used to strengthen the preparation of globally competent educators who cannot travel abroad in order to meet the needs of students who are from a different culture.

 Intimate partner violence (IPV) is an important social issue in American society, yet research on Hispanic college students is limited. With the addition of other social and economic challenges, these Hispanic students struggle to attend college. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence and correlates of IPV among nontraditional Mexican American college students in a Hispanic serving institution. Variables that were examined as possible risk factors for IPV among Hispanic populations included age, gender, approval of violence, level of education and income, and drinking behavior, among others. Overall, results showed that all but the factor of level of income had significant correlations with victimization. Significant variables that were observed will be discussed furthermore.<br>",TBD

 For most families of transplant patients, the impending cost involved in the upcoming medical care is of a high importance while the patient is on the waiting list. There are programs available to the family in order to help alleviate this concern, but no one really talks about what happens after the patient receives the transplant. It is common that the quality of life for the patient will begin to improve, but what about the financial realities faced by the families post-transplant? It is likely that the transplant patients as well as their families are still at somewhat of a disadvantage financially even after receiving support throughout the transplant process.

 This study will focus on pediatric heart transplant recipients, specifically within the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) Region 4, Texas and Oklahoma and their survival rates, post-transplant, based on the types of insurance they possess. The overall goal of this investigation is to help identify disparities between public and private health insurance and to encourage the workings towards a more stabilized system regardless of what health insurance type one chooses.

Using a modified version of the Attributional Style Questionnaire (Peterson et al., 1982) developed for this study, a sample of 122 undergraduate students currently in romantic relationships displayed evidence of a couple-serving bias in which they made internal, stable, and global attributional ratings for their partner's successes and made more external, unstable, and specific attributional ratings for the partner's failures. The sizes of these couple-serving biases were found to be positively related to participants' scores on the relational assessment scale (Hendrick, 1988).

<br>
 The purpose of this research is to measure if there is an association between an individual's psychological reactivity and their latitude of acceptance as operationalized by Social Judgment Theory. Furthermore, researchers will test how attitudes change when confronted with information contrary to their beliefs. The latitude of acceptance is a spectrum of information an individual is willing to accept as a part of their attitude towards a particular subject, in this case immigration. Participants will be given a pre-test using the Thurstone Scale to determine their latitude of acceptance for immigration. Additionally, the Hong Reactance Scale will be administered to determine if an individual's freedom of choice is being threatened or eliminated. We will then test the Backfire Effect by using a Counter Attitudinal Advocacy essay. The Backfire Effect suggests that individuals will have stronger support in the direction of their initial belief after receiving information outside of their latitude of acceptance that is contrary to their initial attitude. We hypothesize the following: Individuals with narrower latitude of acceptance will score higher on the Hong Reactance Scale, individuals with narrower latitude of acceptance will be more likely to backfire, and the Counter Attitudinal Advocacy will be less effective for those with narrow latitude of acceptance who also score high on the Hong Reactance Scale. <br>",TBD

 Faculty are expected to be involved in a variety of duties in their workplace including teaching, scholarship, service and research. According to Trautvetter, Braskamp and Ward (2008) new faculty may struggle with the demands of adjusting to the workload and personal obligations.
<br>
<br>
 The first hypothesis was that women would spend more hours per week on combined work and personal obligations than their male counterparts. The second hypothesis was that more hours would be reported at the beginning of the semester in preparation for classes than at the end of the semester. The third hypothesis was that reported stress levels taken from the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) would continue to increase throughout the semester in our first-year faculty members due to the high demands of the new position.
<br>
<br>
 To conduct this study, we surveyed a total of 45 first-year employees at Tarleton State University. The survey was administered via email at three different points of the fall 2016 semester. Participants self-reported hours spent each week on workload and personal obligations.
<br>
<br>
 An independent samples t-test revealed that males reported working an average of 61 hours, while females reported working an average of 50 hours, 
<i>p</i>&gt;.05. At the beginning of the semester faculty reported an average of 62.4 hours, and at the end of the semester they reported an average of 59.6 hours, <i>p</i>&gt;.05. A repeated measures ANOVA revealed that faculty taking the PSS all three times during the semester indicated stress levels were moderate all semester, <i>p</i>&gt;.05.<br>
<br>
 While the statistical analysis does not support our original hypotheses, we found that participants reported working between 10 and 22 hours more per week than a traditional 40-hour work week, and that faculty were moderately stress at every survey point in the semester. This is important to note when considering faculty burnout and stress.

Drug delivery systems increase the therapeutic efficiency of the chemotherapeutic agent by controlling the rate at which the agent is released from the carrier to the systemic circulation or tissues, minimizing its interaction with non-pathological sites. Available delivery systems exhibit high toxicity. However, natural biomaterial polysaccharides are highly stable, non-toxic, hydrophilic, biodegradable, and abundantly available. These polysaccharides also have low processing costs as compared to current lipid-based and protein-based delivery systems. The presence of hydrophilic groups enables them to form non-covalent bonds with biological tissues. This prolongs the residence time, thus increasing the absorbance of the loaded drug. The overall goal of the present research is to develop a non-toxic plant-derived polysaccharide-based drug/gene delivery system for chemotherapeutic agents. In the research so far, the group has been capable of developing a delivery system derived from the fenugreek plant. Series of tissue culture experiments have been performed to study the safety/toxicity of this polysaccharide based delivery system at varying doses in different cancer cell lines. To date, the results show that this delivery system is not as toxic as some of the delivery systems currently in use. The present poster expands the <i>in vitro </i>safety/toxicity study to include <i>in vivo</i> mouse models. Blood and urine samples were collected and compared to a previous preliminary mouse experiment. Tissue samples were also harvested to determine the efficiency of the polysaccharide delivery system to carry the drug to the targeted cells.

 Illiterate individuals access words more slowly than literate individuals. Those who do not have formal schooling also tend to have difficulties distinguishing words that are phonologically related and accessing words that are less frequently used [Adila et al., 2010, <i>Archives of Clinical Neuropsychology</i>, 25(8)]. The purpose of this research is to assess the progress of illiterate bilinguals locally and internationally, through literacy intervention. Literacy intervention will occur in the participants' non-native language, which will not only elucidate the impact of literacy training on lexical access, but will also help us understand cross-language transfer of these skills (applying the properties of one language to another). We hypothesize that literacy intervention in populations with low educational levels will increase speed in accessing the mental lexicon and phonemic discrimination ability. We also predict that individuals who are receiving literacy training in their non-native language will use the properties of their trained non-native language to make lexical decisions in their untrained native language. The experimental procedure will consist of pre- and post-training assessments of lexical access using a lexical decision task in each of their languages. Participants will classify 30 high-frequency words, 30 low-frequency words, and 60 pseudowords to measure the impact of literacy intervention has on the speed of lexical access. Determining the effects of literacy in the trained and non-trained language will clarify our understanding of cross-language transfer. A major goal of this project is the creation of a lexical decision task that is easy to use in the field with populations without access to formal schooling. Understanding how short-term literacy interventions impact language skills will help educators target their programs, especially in contexts where interventions are time-limited.<br>",TBD

<br>
 Chronic pain affects approximately 100 million Americans. An abundance of research has been dedicated to understanding pain avoidance. However, the choice to escape pain is not possible for chronic pain sufferers so studies asking pain sufferers to approach negative stimuli such as pain while achieving rewards (approach-avoidance) are important. In approach-avoidance decision-making in non-pain contexts, increased alpha frequency activity between the left and right hemisphere of the brain has been reported (prefrontal asymmetry).<br>
<br>
 The first hypothesis of this study was that the chronic pain group would choose to avoid pain stimuli more than a non-pain group (controls). The second hypothesis was that the pain group would demonstrate increased prefrontal asymmetry.<br>
<br>
 Electroencephalogram (EEG) activity was recorded while 14 pain group and 17 control participants were asked to approach/avoid hypothetical stimuli involving a low, medium, or high amount of money simultaneously associated with a low, medium, or high amount of pain (A-A task). <br>
<br>
 A independent samples t-tests revealed that the pain group avoided pain stimuli significantly less than controls, <i>p</i>&lt;.05. Analyses of the brain frequency activity revealed that the pain group did not demonstrate increased prefrontal asymmetry (<i>p</i>&gt;.05), but had significantly less alpha frequency activity in 6 out of 10 electrodes, <i>p</i>&lt;.05. <br>
<br>
 We did not find support for the hypotheses that the pain group would avoid pain less or demonstrate more prefrontal asymmetry. This can be explained because increased prefrontal asymmetry has previously been found in the presence of increased avoidance, which we did not find in this study. Chronic pain sufferers avoided pain less, and demonstrate widespread (multi-electrode) inhibition in the alpha frequency instead of prefrontal asymmetry. To our knowledge, this is the first pain study revealing brain activity during approach-avoidance.<br>",TBD

 During stressful times such as weaning and transportation, dairy calves will encounter immunosuppression and increased risk of disease. Specifically, neutrophil concentration and function may be altered leading to greater incidence or severity of bovine respiratory disease. Our objective was to determine if 3 doses of pegbovigrastim increased neutrophil concentration and function in Jersey bull calves (d 14 BW = 138 ± 34 kg). A commercially-available pegbovigrastim product (Imrestor, Elanco Animal Health) was administered on d 0 to achieve a low (PEGA; 1.11), reference (PEGB; 2.22), and high (PEGC; 4.44 mg/animal) dose to pen-grouped calves (n=11 animals/treatment) with equal treatment representation across pens. Animal was experimental unit and dependent variables were analyzed using PROC MIXED with repeated measures (d). Blood samples were analyzed periodically to determine complete blood count and neutrophil functionality. A treatment×time interaction (<i>P</i>≤0.03) was observed for total white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes. Total WBC increased (<i>P</i>≤0.05) in PEGC claves on d 2 vs. PEGA and was greater than both PEGA and PEGB on d 3, 4, 12, and 14. In addition, PEGC had increased (<i>P</i>&lt;0.01) monocytes on d 3, 4, 12, and 14 vs. PEGA and PEGB and neutrophils were increased for PEGC on d 3, 4, and 14 compared to PEGB. Reduced (<i>P</i>&lt;0.01) expression of L-selectin was observed on d 1 and 2, while increased (<i>P</i>&lt;0.01) expression occurred on d 4. L-selectin decreased (<i>P</i>&lt;0.01) on d 6 until d 14 following the peak on d 4. Phagocytosis intensity was greatest (<i>P</i>&lt;0.01) on d 0 and oxidative burst intensity was greatest (<i>P</i>&lt;0.01) on d 2. Temporal findings suggest pegbovigrastim increases the concentration of various leukocytes, but may cause transient depression of neutrophil function concomitant with rapid production of immature neutrophils. We suggest PEGB may be the most appropriate pegbovigrastim dose in light-weight dairy calves.<br>",TBD

Education should be the window to all students discovering who they are, and how they fit in relation to what awaits them in the real world – regardless of their race or ethnicity.  Many educational institutions function from a cultural deficit standpoint, and the results are evident in the drastic failures in males of color, particularly black males. Black male students should have safe, thought-provoking, and enriching experiences in school. Educators should be free to impart wisdom and knowledge to every student that reflects an honest account that guides them to realize their full potential. Acknowledgement and understanding of issues that impact individuals, families, institutions, and society from the perspective of varying backgrounds, races, ethnicities, religious beliefs, and cultural differences can accomplish this. The impact of this perspective not being utilized in schools has caused an educational disconnect that is a detriment to black male students.

 Enrollment trends among students with disabilities continue to show significant increases over the past decades at institutions of higher education despite being traditionally underrepresented at postsecondary educational settings (Beilke &amp; Yssel, 1999; Olney, Kennedy, Brockelman, &amp; Newsom, 2004; &amp; Palombi, 2000). Increased enrollment among this emerging population at two and four year universities is possible through the Americans with Disabilities Act (1990) and the Rehabilitation Act (1973). Students enrolling with disabilities at postsecondary institutions often times refuse to disclose or self-identify themselves with disability service departments based on prior oppressive experiences. Presently, limited research exists on the learning and experiences of student athletes attending HBCU's. However, other studies focused on the student athletes overall experience with academic advising and counseling services received. (Newell, 2015) The voice of student athletes with physical or learning disabilities is an enigma that has yet to evolve into the conception of postsecondary discourse. Allowing these individuals to disclose their experiences while attending an HBCU may provide a pivotal direction that could impact the policy and practices of higher education institutions disability service programs in Texas, in addition to, the policy and documentation requirements of the National Collegiate Athletic Association Division-I Level (NCAA- DI Level). These “unspoken truths” of student athletes with disabilities could affect their ability to receive the necessary accommodations needed to matriculate successfully through degree granting programs.

Investigators will be conducting a survey to be done by 1000 randomly selected credentialed ATCs. The participants will complete the survey collecting their demographics and also a questionnaire in regards to burnout. We determine that gender and career settings are going to be the most common reason of burnout. We believe females and ATs in the collegiate level will have the highest burnout rates in this study. We believe this study will allow us to look into different genders, work settings, and various other factors to determine precursors to burnout. Determining the precursors and indicators of burnout will allow for suggestions of ways to prevent burnout in the athletic training profession and allow for the best quality care to be provided for all our athletes and patients.<br>

Participants in the first study rated several relationships on how much stigma they believed each one of them faced, and then determined how much the individuals in each relationship loved each other—the perception of the Romeo and Juliet effect. In the second study, participants were given a scenario of a male, gay relationship, and had to determine how much the couple loved each other, depending on how much stigma was ascribed to them. The results suggest that there is a perception that the Romeo and Juliet effect exists, despite evidence that does not. Furthermore, individuals in relationships, which face stigma from more than once source, are believed to love each other more. Together, the results suggest that perceived stigma and love in a relationship are positively associated, which runs counter to better supported models of relationship satisfaction.<br>",TBD

8786632,"Bowman, Kristen",Tarleton State University - Education,"The Dynamics of Spatial-Operational Momentum In Mental Arithmetic <br>
<br>
 Background<br>
 Many studies in numerical cognition have demonstrated an association between representations of numbers and space. Additionally, there is some evidence that this association extends to mental arithmetic. For example, Pinhas, Shaki, and Fischer (2014) demonstrated a spatial operational momentum (SOM); that is, when participants pointed on a number line to indicate answers to arithmetic problems, the mean landing positions for addition problems were significantly further rightward of the mean landing positions for subtraction problems. In the present study, we used computer mouse tracking to further investigate the continuous evolution of this SOM effect.<br>
<br>
 Method<br>
 Seventy participants were presented with several experimental trials in which a number line was presented at the top of the computer screen. Upon moving the computer mouse upward from the bottom center of the screen, a single-digit addition or subtraction problem appeared. Participants were then instructed to move the mouse cursor upward to the number line and cross the line at the approximate location of the sum/difference.<br>
<br>
 Results<br>
 In contrast to Pinhas et al. (2014), we did not find that the mean landing position for addition problems as farther rightward of the mean landing position for subtraction. Instead, we found that the pattern depended on problem size. For small problems, the landing position for addition problems were slightly left of the landing position for subtraction problems. For large problems, this pattern was reversed. However, we did find evidence of a dynamic SOM effect; that is, throughout much of the decision process, the computer mouse trajectories for addition problems drifted rightward of the trajectories for subtraction problems.<br>
<br>
Conclusion<br>
 Our failure to replicate the SOM effect on landing positions calls the results of Pinhas et al. (2014) into question. However, our discovery of a possible dynamic SOM indicates a need for further investigation into the locus of spatial-arithmetical associations. <br>",TBD

 Video games are a 100 Billion dollar industry whose narrative content has wide reaching global influence. Modern video games are often highly plot driven and contain significant representations of social norms, roles and structures. As such they have a strong cultural influence and impact in our society. Past research has shown that underrepresented groups in video games are often oversexualized and stigmatized by negative stereotypes and tropes. This study examines representations of characters' race, gender, and sexual orientation in the top 10 grossing mass market video games and top 10 indie video games of 2016. It was hypothesized that indie video games would offer more numerical diversity and more balanced representation of these underrepresented groups due to the fact that indie video games often have less standardized corporate structures and more creator diversity. Results show that Indie games are more likely to feature traditionally underrepresented groups and more likely to show these groups exhibiting complex character structure and integration into the main plot of the video game. Comparatively, top grossing mass market video games that have more strict editorial guidelines and less diverse corporate structures tend to have less numerical and more stereotypical representation of underrepresented groups.<br>",TBD

 <b>ABSTRACT</b><br>
<br>
 The purpose of this research is to explore the effectiveness of nanosilica to enhance the compressive strength of problematic soils reinforced with cement. Through recent studies, nanosilica has been found to increase the compressive strength of cement by a considerable amount, and therefore its application for soil reinforcement is a topic worthy of interest. The results here are accomplished through the comparative testing of soil samples using unconfined compression testing and material characterization on a microscopic scale. While the characterization testing is still underway, the compression tests alone prove that nanosilica provides a significant increase in the compressive strength of soil and cement mixtures, and as such can be considered a viable option for the purpose of reinforcing expansive soils.<br>

 With the recent Zika outbreak and the spread of other vector-borne diseases, there is a crucial need for mosquito surveillance and effective methods of control. Finding correlations between elevated mosquito density and significant climatic patterns are key factors for understanding the distribution of mosquitoes. We evaluated mosquito density in 3.2 km2 sections of three residential areas in San Antonio, TX. These zones were chosen as part of a larger study to evaluate the effect of differences in socio-economic factors on mosquito density. In each section, 36 Autocidal Gravid Ovitraps (AGO traps) were placed in residential front yards. We visited each trap weekly to count and identify mosquitoes. Our focus was on the important mosquito vector species 
<i>Culex quinquefasciatus</i>, <i>Aedes aegypti,</i> and <i>Aedes albopictus</i>. Daily precipitation, temperature, and humidity levels were gathered from weather stations near each zone through the Wunderground.com website. Preliminary results suggest that the three zones differed in total weekly precipitation, with the central zone receiving the most rain, and that total weekly precipitation of 2.5cm to 6.8cm resulted in a 2-week delayed increase in mosquito density. In the singular heavy precipitation event (&gt;7.6cm total weekly precipitation) mosquito numbers were immediately reduced. As we continue to collect data, we will evaluate if precipitation affects each of the three mosquito species differently. Temperatures did not differ significantly among the three areas. The total number of mosquitoes decreased when temperatures were over 87oF and when rain was absent. There were little differences in humidity among areas and humidity did not appear to affect mosquito densities. As we continue to collect data, further analysis may reveal how local spatial climatic variability within residential areas across large cities may affect mosquito densities and our ability to implement effective control.<br>",TBD

Grassland restoration practices offer opportunities to mitigate the declines in bobwhite populations. Therefore, it is useful to address the effectiveness of such practices focused on improving bobwhite populations and vegetation communities upon which they rely. In Spring and Summer 2017 we radio-marked and located 133 bobwhites across two landscape types, treated and non-restored, to monitor nest and adult survival. Treated landscapes underwent restoration practices including native grass reseeding, prescribed grazing, and brush removal within the past 3 years. At each adult location and nest site, we measured visual obstruction using Robel poles and herbaceous ground cover using 25×50-cm Daubenmire frames. We used Program MARK known-fate analysis to analyze adult survival and built nest survival models using AICc model selection to determine the influence of vegetation characteristics and camera. Adults and nests in treated landscapes have higher survival rates, 38.6% (n = 68) and 31.1% (n = 14), than those in non-restored landscapes, 8.5% (n = 65) and 19.4% (n = 9) respectively. Vegetation characteristics were strongly supported as predictors of nest success. Nest survival increased as the season progressed, herbaceous ground cover and visual obstruction increased, and litter ground cover decreased. We also ran Welch's t-tests comparing adult location and nest site ground cover. Adult locations differed in litter (19.23 ± 20.39), (23.06 ± 24.87), t698.74 = 2.31, <i>P</i> = 0.021, grass (48.51 ± 31.80), (40.15 ± 30.91), t768.23 = -3.72, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001, wood (1.94 ± 11.02), (5.63 ± 19.79), t546.47 = 3.15, <i>P</i> = 0.002, canopy cover (20.51 ± 38.82), (26.89 ± 42.64), t546.47 = 3.15, <i>P</i> = 0.002, and visual obstruction (20.01 ± 18.83), (25.47 ± 25.41), t657.35 = 3.36, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001 between treated and non-restored landscapes, respectively.

These results support our hypotheses that the implemented restoration practices influence bobwhite habitats and improving survival across the treated landscapes.

 <b>Abstract</b><br>
Single walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) and poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) composites have various potential applications and ionizing radiation detection is one of them. This paper presents part of an investigation of the ionizing and indirectly ionizing (high energy relativistic neutrons) radiation effects on electrical resistance of the nanomaterial composites. During earlier experimental studies with high energy neutrons, initial positive results could not be duplicated. However, the present work suggests that the reason for this is that the specific steps in the processing of the nanocomposites are critical for their function as radiation detecting materials. The synthesized thin film of nanomaterial composite in our study was exposed to x-ray radiation emitted from 160-KV x-ray radiation source during the experiments to study the effects of ionizing radiation on the electrical resistance of synthesized composites. The experimental data shows quasi-linear response curve with radiation dose for nanomaterial composites which were sonicated with ice bath. The results indicate that the ice bath is a critical process component in forming the network of nanotubes that allows the radiation effect on the film resistance to be measured. Previously published work suggests that nanomaterial sensing element based on relatively economical multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) and SWCNT might be useful in detecting ionizing or indirectly ionizing radiation.<br>

Many universities across the country are hard pressed to increase student enrollment due to state and/or governing board mandates. As minority groups, other than African Americans, are recruited, admitted, and enrolled into Historically Black College and Universities (HBCUs), these institutions must use innovative and competitive strategies (Oguntoyinbo, 2015) to retain these students and assist them with navigation until graduation. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, US Department of Labor (2012), the projected numbers of Latinos entering the workforce is 19% by year 2020 and 24% by year 2050. Yet, only one in six Latinos over 25, employed in the US, attained a college degree (Cárdenas &amp; Kerby, 2012). This suggests that with the growing population, HBCUs must find specific ways in which to recruit and retain Latino students. Therefore, the purpose of this quantitative descriptive and predictive study is two-fold. First, the investigator seeks to determine the factors that influence Latino male students to persist at an HBCU in Texas. Second, the investigator will explore factors that can predict the academic achievement, as measured by GPA, of persistent Latino male students at an HBCU in Texas. The population for this study will be Latino male students from an HBCU in Texas. The researcher will employ a random sampling technique to generate the sample for this study. All Latino male students will have an equal opportunity to participate in the study. Statistical manipulations will be done using SPSS 18.0.<br>
<br>
The findings from this research will add to the body of knowledge on the persistence of Latino students at colleges and universities in America. It will serve as a model that can be replicated across America and the world, in order to generate new knowledge that can inform policies and practices regarding the persistence of Latino students. <br>",TBD

Milk quality and consistency are two of the most important considerations and are affected by the monthly and scheduled maintenance for the mechanical systems within the dairy. In order to meet quality standards, specific nozzles, hoses, fittings, etc. must be tested and replaced on a precise schedule. A database was created in Microsoft Access to outline the specific tasks that the dairy must complete to ensure proper product quality. The database allows the information to be presented each month for the dairy, listing the tasks to be completed. In addition, a forecasting option allows the dairies to see what tasks are upcoming and prepares them for the future.

 Estimating different components of water budget of a watershed is one of the main applications of hydrologic models. Evapotranspiration (ET) is one of the most important components in watershed hydrologic balance as it is considered as the largest outflow from watershed in semi-arid regions. However, direct measurement of ET is not practical due to spatial variability of climate, land-use, and soil type. Therefore, physically-based distributed hydrological models have been considered as a valuable tool to estimate ET at basin-scale. One of the challenges in application of physically-based, distributed basin-wide models is the calibration due to high numbers of model parameters. Stochastic calibration and validation give the advantages of considering all kinds of errors and uncertainties using multiple combinations of input parameters. We evaluated one of widely used hydrological model (SWAT) in estimating ET in a large, semi-arid watershed with stochastic calibration and validation for only river discharge. SWAT was stochastically calibrated and validated for monthly river discharge at multiple stations during 1980-1994 and 1995-2010, respectively. Simulated ET was compared with in-situ ET measurements between 2007 and 2009. Results showed good performance of SWAT in simulating streamflow and ET.<br>",TBD

 A major focus for universities is to recruit quality faculty and retain them. Faculty face more challenges than ever before which may place added stress and pressure on them. A lack of purposeful mentoring may be contributing to this dilemma, specifically related to gender. Mixed methods (Creswell, 2013; Creswell &amp; Plano Clark, 2011) were used to determine faculty responsibilities and professional development needs at a rural university in Texas. Quantitative results from a cross sectional survey provided an overview of the faculty needs. Focus groups assisted with further explaining the professional development needs of faculty and specific areas of interest among faculty ranks. Data were collected in two phases: (1) an electronic survey was sent to tenure track faculty (N=269; 48.3%) and (2) focus groups including a representative sample of faculty at each rank to expand on findings from the survey and to contextualize participants' responses. Participants included Assistant Professors (N = 114), Associate Professors (N = 52), and Professors (N = 46) who served in positions across the university. Qualitative and quantitative data were triangulated to reinforce the validity of the constructs and to contextualize participant responses. Results suggested that a change in culture should occur. This change should include support for women who would like to (or already) have families as well as encouraging senior women faculty members to serve as role models and guides. Another recommendation was for mentoring to be acknowledged and rewarded by administration of the institution. Several additional recommendations were made.<br>",TBD

 Ever since the Enlightenment relegated it to a pseudo-science, those interested in alchemy have struggled to be taken seriously. This includes contemporary scholars of alchemy, whose work only recently has entered the ranks of the history of early modern science. This recent success is due to a historiographic shift towards writing the social and cultural history of alchemy. This paper contributes to that shift by examining the connection between alchemy and the body by drawing from early modern texts that were owned, used, and/or written by seventeenth-century English alchemists. Rather than present alchemy as the mastery of esoteric knowledge, it argues that alchemy was fundamentally an embodied practice. The argument is one in three parts. First, alchemical knowledge and practice depended on the senses, specifically sight, taste, and smell. Second, alchemists frequently used bodily secretions as ingredients in alchemical formulae. Finally, the body was used allegorically to describe the ""noble science""<a name=""_ftnref1"">[1]</a>, further reinforcing the inextricable embodiment of alchemy. This study makes a significant contribution to the history of alchemy, the history of the body, and the emerging field of sensory history. Through emphasizing the body, it breaks new ground by shifting the scholarly focus away from alchemy (the equipment, the language, the symbols) and instead highlighting the alchemists themselves. <br>

 Despite the recent advancements in glycemic control for diabetic patients, the realization of an automated closed-loop artificial pancreas is still a challenge. The purpose of this research is to develop an integrated control system for in <i>silico</i> closed loop administration of insulin for Type 1 diabetic patients based on patients' medical record and real-time control-relevant data. The proposed system consists of a virtual patient model from the online AIDA diabetes simulator, a neural network predictor trained on patients' data for feedback purposes, a Proportional-Integral Controller and data logging nodes. The virtual patient takes into account the delayed and time-varying insulin and carbohydrate absorption rate associated with the existing subcutaneous insulin delivery and complex glucose metabolism, respectively. The neural network predictor was trained using 23 features including semi-static and dynamic data, with built-in knowledge of all available past blood glucose levels. Then the controller calculates the infusion bolus to be delivered by the insulin pump. Extensive simulations are performed and it is shown that the neural network predictor has less Root-Mean-Square error than the currently used continuous glucose monitors, which takes measurement from the interstitial fluid. Simulation results also demonstrate that our proposed data-driven closed loop system for glycemic control can effectively regulate the blood glucose level of Type 1 diabetic patients without hypoglycemic excursions, and with no preset instruction on meal ingestion.<br>",TBD

<b>ABSTRACT:</b><br>
 The city of Aguascalientes in central Mexico has recently experienced frequent haze events. In accordance with the recent events, the Universidad Autónoma de Aguascalientes has collected atmospheric particulate matter from an agricultural environment by passing known air volumes through quartz fiber membrane filters. This work seeks to quantify the chemical composition and morphological characteristics of atmospheric particulate matter (PM) collected from an agricultural area of Aguascalientes, Mexico. The chemical composition of the PM will be determined by using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP/MS) and ion chromatography (IC), with a focus on heavy metals (Pb, Cr, As, Hg, etc.). The morphological characteristics of the atmospheric PM will be analyzed with the use of a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The preliminary results indicate a detectable amount of Cr, Pb, and Al; however, a better digestion method must be developed and more elements must be analyzed to develop a thorough characterization of the atmospheric particulate matter. After characterization, the particulate matter will be allocated to the suspected sources using a positive matrix factorization (PMF) model.

 Abstract: Invasive feral pigs cost the United States over $1.5 billion in damages and control costs each year. With a growing population of over 5 million pigs in the United States, various population control methods are now being considered. Gossypol is a toxic compound found in the cotton plant and has long been known to be toxic to simple stomached (monogastric) animals such as pigs. High concentrations of gossypol can be responsible for respiratory issues, anorexia, general weakness, and death; however the most common toxic effect is the impairment of male and female reproduction (Gadelha et al., 2014). The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of cottonseed meal on the reproductive viability of first parity gilts and third parity sows. A total of 18 sows were blocked by age and placed in to one of two treatment groups: control (CON); 1.814kg of ground sow feed (Linders 690, Comfort,TX) or treatment(TRT); 1.361kg of cottonseed meal (CSM) and .454kg of ground sow feed (Linders 690) daily for 80 d post confirmed bred. At farrowing, number born alive, number of still born, mummies, abnormalities and defects, and number weaned were recorded. Blood was collected from piglets at day 3, 10, 17, 21 and analyzed for a complete blood count using a IDEXX-Procyte (Westbrook, ME.). All data were then analyzed using a PROC GLM in SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC.). Results indicate that dietary cottonseed meal of 60% of the total diet will result in negative effects on reproduction measures and viability of piglets. <br>",TBD

 <b>Abstract</b><br>
 Storm surges onto coastal lowlands are common events during tropical storms, tsunamis, and hurricanes. Hurricane Harvey made landfall in southern Texas and Louisiana during the last week of August 2017. From August 26 to 30, more than 50 inches (127 cm) of rain were recorded at various locations in Harris County. Numerous public and private groundwater wells of Harris County were inundated due to flooding and storm surge. The main goal of this research was to investigate the impact of hurricane Harvey's storm surge on shallow and deep groundwater storage in the Harris County, Texas. We selected two aquifers: Carrizo-Wilcox and Gulf Coast to understand the impact of storm surge on groundwater storage. We used hourly tides and current products and groundwater level data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Texas Water Development Board (TWDB), respectively. Analysis showed that Houston downtown areas were submerged by 11.8 ft. (3.6 m) of surging water for several days. On the other hand, shallow to medium depth groundwater wells showed a sudden rise in groundwater levels under the storm surge. However, the significant impact of the storm surge was observed in shallow wells located in the coastal lowlands. For example, shallow and medium groundwater wells showed water levels elevated to 2.4 and 0.6 m (7.9 and 2.0 ft.), respectively, whereas no water level rises were recorded in deep groundwater wells. Since natural recharge of aquifers through infiltration is a slow process, the sudden rise of groundwater level showed flood water might have entered into the well through structural damages and well vents and contaminated it. The applied approach helps water resources managers and other stakeholders to identify the wells impacted by flood/storm surge and determine if, and to what extent, contamination to the groundwater has occurred.<br>",TBD

 Abstract
<br>
 As government and institutions seek to broaden the availability and accessibility of higher education, institutions are challenged with the task of creating educational opportunities that accommodate the needs of contemporary students and other stakeholders (Cunningham, Key, &amp; Capron, 2016). Competency-based education (CBE) is a method of instruction and learning that grants course credit to students based on their demonstration of mastery of well-defined competencies or skills (EDUCAUSE, 2014). Although CBE has recently received increased attention, little research has been published related to best practices regarding building competency-based programs and quality assessments (Cunningham, Key, &amp; Capron, 2016). Therefore, institutions are continuously challenged to ensure the quality of CBE programs by attempting to find and utilize innovative methods of measuring student learning outcomes (Gervais, 2016). The current research offers an overview of common methods institutions are utilizing in assessment of student learning outcomes within their CBE programs. By outlining common assessment practices used in existing CBE programs, the current research can assist institutions in the unification of efforts to achieve quality standards in CBE program assessment.

 The digestive tract of honeybees contains a specialized organ called the honey stomach that functions to process nectar into honey, and the honey stomach may host a microbiome that is specialized and contributes to the production of honey. Honey produced by different bee hives varies considerably in appearance, taste, and commercial viability due to its chemical composition, and the microbiome of the honey stomach may influence the compositional makeup of the honey. Microbiomes in the digestive systems of other organisms are known to produce sugars, antioxidants, vitamins, and other metabolites, all of which are known to affect honey quality. The aims of this study are to i) characterize the microbiome of the honey stomach to determine if it differs from the microbiome of the remainder of the gastrointestinal tract and ii) determine if the microbiome of the honey stomach contributes to the compositional makeup of honey. Microbiome differences between the honey stomach and gastrointestinal tract are determined by dissecting honeybees, and separately removing the honey stomach and the remainder of the gastrointestinal tract. Then the microbiomes of each sample are characterized by 16S rRNA amplification and sequencing and analyzed using QIIME. To determine if the honey stomach microbiome contributes to the compositional makeup of honey, key metabolites produced by the microorganism identified in the honey stomach microbiome were identified and compared to the results of biochemical assays used for chemical analysis of honey. We have found that the microbiome of the honey stomach differs from the microbiome in the remainder of the gastrointestinal tract in every honeybee tested. We also found correlations between the presence of acetic acid and the presence of acetic acid producing bacteria in the honey stomach microbiomes of honeybees from the same hive, suggesting that the honey stomach microbiome influences the composition and quality of honey.<br>",TBD

 Hyperspectral imaging is used to collect and processes information from various electromagnetic spectrum. They have been successfully used to obtain the spectrum for each pixel in an image such that objects are found, material types are detected and process can be better understood. They have been used in many scientific applications such as environmental monitoring, medical diagnosis, precision agriculture and many others. Due to the variability of targets and background in hyperspectral imaging, processing these types of images is a challenging task because of the high dimensionality. Thus, the choice of a subset of bands to process in an image appears to be an effective approach to alleviate the above problem. But, finding an optimal subset of bands is computationally expensive since it requires the investigation of all possible combinations of bands. Therefore, we propose a two-step method to solve the dimensionality reduction problem of hyperspectral images for object classification. The first step comprises of finding an optimal subset of bands using a Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA). MOGA allows us to search the complex space of sub-bands in a much better way using many goals. We adopted two objectives: the maximization of the interclass separability and the minimization in the number of bands. In the second step, we solve the image classification problem with less complexity. We plan to compare our method with Swarm Optimization and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with respect to execution time and accuracy. The proposed method is promising and can offer a reduction for both time and computation complexity.<br>

 Passenger vehicles emit 4.7 metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) annually in the US, and this accounts for 60% of the total national CO2 emissions from light-duty vehicles. In order to reduce gasoline and diesel use and thus the tailpipe emissions from vehicles, electric vehicles and vehicles fueled by alternative fuels are getting more attention. However, when dealing with alternative fuel vehicles cost and alternative fuel storage, e.g. hydrogen storage, are major concerns. Also, transportation policymakers and the public are concerned that the use of electric vehicles simply transfers pollution to upstream power plants. It is imperative that the impacts of vehicles powered by electricity and alternate fuels on the environment. This study examines life cycle emissions of passenger vehicles powered by E10, pure ethanol, BD20, natural gas, hydrogen and electricity by using a life cycle assessment tool known as Greenhouse Gases (GHGs), Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation (GREET) model. In detail, energy use and different emissions such as GHGs, VOC, NOx, SOx, PM10 and PM2.5 are evaluated for these vehicles from well to wheels in the years 2017 and 2022. The simulations show significant reductions in GHGs, VOC, CO and NOx when the vehicles are powered by ethanol and electricity although electric vehicles contribute to more SOx emissions. The vehicles powered by natural gas contribute to less life cycle emissions of GHGs, VOC, PM10 and PM2.5, but more emissions of CO and NOx. There are more life cycle emissions of GHGs, NOx, SOx, PM10 and PM2.5 associated with the hydrogen vehicles based on the current technologies for hydrogen production.<br>",TBD

Athletic trainers (AT) see injuries and medical conditions happen on a daily basis. Their job is to ensure the safety of their athletes on and off the field/court. However, when the mental and emotional factors of an athletic trainer become disrupted and AT becomes burned out from the profession, and the quality of care for their athletes/patients declines. The main focus of this study is to find out the precursors and indicators of burnout in athletic trainers. Investigators will be conducting a survey to be done by 1000 randomly selected credentialed ATCs. The participants will complete the survey collecting their demographics and also a questionnaire in regards to burnout. We determine that gender and career settings are going to be the most common reason of burnout. We believe females and ATs in the collegiate level will have the highest burnout rates in this study. We believe this study will allow us to look into different genders, work settings, and various other factors to determine precursors to burnout. Determining the precursors and indicators of burnout will allow for suggestions of ways to prevent burnout in the athletic training profession and allow for the best quality care to be provided for all our athletes and patients.<br>

 In recent years kisspeptin (Kiss) has been found to be the main regulator of the gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) system. This system is responsible for the pulsatile secretion of GnRH neurons facilitating the onset of puberty, reproduction including gametogenesis, and overall development. Sex steroid hormones produced in gonads bind to receptors on Kiss neurons and regulate the release of Kiss which ultimately regulates the release of GnRH. Interfering with the natural provision of these chemicals can have impairing or disruptive consequences for the feedback control of the Kiss-GnRH system. With an increasing presence of synthetically produced hormones and hormone mimicking compounds in surface water, aquatic systems are now more than ever exposed to such chemicals. The purpose of this study is to shed light on the disruptive effects of estrogenic chemicals on the Kiss-GnRH system. The experiment is performed on zebrafish with dose-depend treatments of ethinyl estradiol (synthetic estrogen) and bisphenol-A (BPA). The fish were injected with 0.1, 1 and 10 nmol/kg of ethinyl estradiol and BPA on days 0, 7, 14 with the control group receiving sham injections. After 21 days the fish were sacrificed and brain and gonad tissue were extracted. Hormonal Kiss and GnRH peptide levels were analyzed by using enzyme-linked immunoassays. Gonad tissues were analyzed for histological changes. The results of this study will provide more details on the correlation of estrogenic stimuli on Kiss neurons, the effects of the Kiss system independently, as well as in reference to the GnRH system. Obtained data can be used as reference points for environmental evaluations for estrogenic chemical impact in aquatic organisms by using zebrafish as a model.

 <b>ABSTRACT </b><br>
 Multiple studies of bilingualism and its cognitive enhancements have yielded many results providing converging evidence that bilinguals, when compared with monolinguals, show advantages in non-linguistic tasks which require higher level cognitive control. Investigation of this “bilingual advantage” demonstrated that in the non-linguistic tasks that involve resolving conflicting information to inhibit an automatic incorrect response, bilinguals outperform monolinguals. The purpose of this study is to discern whether young adult English-Spanish bilinguals have an advantage, a faster reaction time and greater accurate performance, over English monolinguals while performing the Eriksen Flanker task, a conflict resolution task involving congruent and incongruent arrow patterns which requires conflict resolution and inhibitory control. Bilingual and monolingual participants from Texas A&amp;M University - Kingsville were asked to perform preliminary verbal language fluency testing followed by the flanker test. An Electrocardiogram (ECG) was used to measure electrical activity of the heart and a respiration amplifier measured respiration to compare bilinguals' and monolinguals' Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA), the synchronization of heart rate and respiration, during the flanker test. RSA is an indicator of mental effort; the greater the synchronization is, the less mental effort used. This study is currently recruiting participants who meet the criteria of strongly monolingual or strongly bilingual. However, it is hypothesized that bilinguals will present an advantage over monolinguals in conflict resolution tasks based on previous research, evident in both their behavioral task performance and in less mental effort as measured by RSA. <br>",TBD

 <b>Abstract </b><br>
 This research studies the defense strategy of an interdependent system in the face of rational attacks. We propose a sequential game between an attacker and a defender on an interdependent system of systems (SoS) to explore the effect of interdependency on the optimal defense strategy. An algorithm of backward induction is developed to determine the equilibrium path of the game. The attacker is the first mover as he applies an attack strategy on constituent systems that maximize his utility. The defender observes and responds by an optimal defense strategy which maximizes her utility. The utility is evaluated as the difference between a player's reward and the cost of the action. The sensitivity analysis is carried out to compare the effects of different parameters on the attacker and defender's strategies such as the effectiveness of defense, the effectiveness of attack, the unit cost of defense and the unit cost of attack on constituent systems.<br>

 Development of Effective Experimental Procedures for Studying Surface-Subsurface Exchange of Synthetic Microfibers in Aquatic Systems <br>
<br>
 A wide range of plastic particles with sizes ranging from micron meters to meters are continuously entering the natural environment. Particles smaller than five millimeter are known as microplastics. Microplastics are diverse in size, shape, color, specific density, chemical composition, and other characteristics. Microplastics particles are a growing global concern since they have been found in lakes, oceans, and agriculture land. While most attention has been paid to microplastics in personal care products, recent research has demonstrated that microfibers, mostly from synthetic fabrics, vastly outnumber the former. Microfibers are released when clothes are washed, which then travel to municipal wastewater treatment systems where some proportion is released into surface waters. It has been found that toxins such as dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane and polychlorinated Biphenyl bind with microfibers, which serves as a transport mechanism. Due to their small size, microfibers are often ingested by fish and other aquatic species, the transport and fate of these microfibers in aquatic environments are poorly understood. The ultimate goal of this project is to examine the fate and transport of microplastics in river and estuarine systems. In this study, effective methodologies are being developed for further studying the fate and transport of microplastics in natural aquatic environment.",TBD

 The ability to visualize and analyze data has given us an important resource in discovering insights from data. This research is aimed to provide an analytics tool and the ready ability to identify groundwater and associated climatic variables such as temperature and precipitation from historical to near real-time scale. Groundwater is an important source for drinking water, industry and irrigated agriculture with the latter being the largest consumer of groundwater resources in Texas. In semi-arid and drought-prone areas, groundwater becomes a primary source to fulfill water demands. The main goal of this research was to create a web-based tool to visualize changes in groundwater levels over the past decade as well as current groundwater level in near real-time across the state. With this information, we can substantially predict how the groundwater levels will change in the future. To build this interactive web-based tool, we used daily meteorological and groundwater data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Texas Water Development Board (TWDB), respectively. This web-based tool helps farmers, ranchers, water resources managers and other stakeholders to monitor groundwater level and its associated climatic variables in near real-time and aid in the overall decision-making process. <br>

Congestion management is a mechanism to prioritize the transactions and commit to such a schedule which would not overload the network. The objective of this research is to develop indices for congestion management in deregulated power system with Distributed Generation (DG) units. An effective technique used to evaluate the impact of distributed generation on a distribution power system is the particle swarm optimization PSO/GA algorithm, which determines the optimal placement and size of the DG unit with an emphasis on improving system reliability while minimizing power losses, improved voltage magnitude profile and more importantly congestion relief.

The OWC generates power by a self-rectifying electric turbine displacing the air inside the OWC due to the rise and fall of the water level caused by sea waves. A small-scale computer-aided design (CAD) model was produced to quantify and analyze the difference in power generation through ANSYS Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. It was found that the power generation of the BBDB was in fact greater than the FFDB. It was observed that annual average power generation using wave data from buoy 42099 was smaller than the other locations tested.

 Literacy has been found to impact cognition, such as attention, visual-spatial abilities, lexical decision-making, and working memory. The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of one week of literacy training on selective attention and automaticity of reading. To assess this, the classic Stroop Test will be administered to illiterate Spanish-English bilinguals before and after one week literacy training. During this task, they will name the font color of a visually presented color word (e.g., “red”) and ignore the meaning of that word (e.g., “green”). In literate individuals, when meaning and font color are incongruent, meaning interferes with processing and delays response times. The Stroop task is thought to measure selective attention and information processing speed. The experiment will consist of the Stroop Test in three formats: Spanish, English, and an alternative version for illiterate participants. The alternative version consists of colors and numbers to assess an interference effect that is independent of reading automaticity. The assessments will be administered on illiterate adults locally and globally. It is expected that illiterate participants will see a decrease in performance on the Spanish Stroop Test as a result of the literacy training. If training in the dominant language impacts reading ability in the non-dominant language, performance should also decrease on the English Stroop Test. If these effects are attenuated due to gains in attention rather than automaticity of reading, performance on the illiterate Stroop task will increase. Understanding the impact of literacy on cognition will clarify our understanding of literacy development in children and mental deterioration in older adults. <br>",TBD

Approximately 20% of Texas students do not meet state Algebra standards. Over 35% of students with disabilities, who receive free and reduced lunch, and students of color do not meet state standards. Therefore, it is critical that both mathematics and special educators work collaboratively to meet the needs of all students. Mathematics education and special education researchers tend to choose very theoretical frameworks for their studies. While multiple research perspectives can help researchers understand a topic in greater depth, it can also make communication between fields and synthesizing research difficult. To understand the literature base available, we completed a qualitative meta-synthesis of algebra studies. First, a systemic search of the literature published from 1974 to 2016 in PsyInfo, ERIC, ProQuest, JSTOR, and Academic Search Complete was completed. Next, hand searches of prominent special education and mathematics education journals were completed and finally ancestral searches of articles. Search results yielded 69 articles and dissertations; 47 met over 60% of Brantlinger et al.'s (2005) quality and relevance criteria. Inclusion and quality inter-rater reliability was 100%. There were nine major themes found in the qualitative data. Most were in specific algebra techniques or group discussion. Findings suggest the need for many areas of additional areas of inquiry to effectively meet the needs of algebra learners.<br>",TBD

<strong><b>Title:</b> Identification with Nerds and Geeks<br>
</strong>
<br>
<b>Problem </b><br>
People identify with many different group identities (Reysen et al., 2014), however not very much research has been conducted on what differentiates the term “geek"" with “nerd."" However, in recent researchers (Campbell et al., 2015) have suggested there is a distinction in the identities. In the present study we examined self-reported identification with nerd and geek identities from a social identity perspective (Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1979) as well as through the lens of the identities from Campbell and colleagues (2015). <br>
<br>
<b>Method</b><br>
Participants (<i>N</i> = 219) completed measures of ingroup identification (Leach et al., 2008; Reysen et al., 2013) and a geek identity scale (Campbell et al., 2015) referencing both nerd and geek identity categories.<br>
<br>
<b>Results</b><br>
The results showed that participants rated nerd identification significantly higher than geek identification across various dimensions of ingroup identification (solidarity, satisfaction, centrality, self-stereotyping). However, participants rated geek identity significantly higher than nerd for the geek identity scale. Correlations also showed that the geek identity scale was not significantly associated with dimensions of ingroup identification as traditionally measured in social identity research.<br>
<br>
<b>Conclusion</b><br>
The purpose of the present study was to examine if there were any differences in identification between geek and nerd category labels. Participants rated nerd identification significantly higher than geek identification across various dimensions of ingroup identification (solidarity, satisfaction, centrality, self-stereotyping). The possible reasons for the lack of association between the geek identity scale are discussed.<br>

 Hypothermia, during the perioperative period, is one of the most preventable risks of general anesthesia, but is still the most common side effect experienced by surgical patients. Hypothermia is diagnosed when a patient's temperature decreases below 36.0°C. If untreated, hypothermia can potentially lead to other adverse clinical outcomes that may be irreversible. Forced-air systems, such as the Bair Hugger, have been the standard warming technique in most facilities. However, other warming methods, such as resistive warming, have also been successful in the prevention of hypothermia. The purpose of this integrative systematic review of the literature was to evaluate the effectiveness of resistive warming compared to forced-air warming in preventing hypothermia during the perioperative period. CINAHL, MedLine, and Cochrane Library databases were searched using the following terms: 
<i>adults, perioperative, hypothermia, resistive warming, and forced-air warming.</i> Inclusion criteria consisted of articles published between 2007-2017 in English; adult surgical patients; compared resistive to forced-air warming; and quality appraisal score of at least 3.5 out of 5. The initial search yielded 250 articles. Each article was analyzed for the use of resistive or forced-air warming, type of anesthesia, surgical duration, position and core body temperature outcomes. A total of five randomized controlled trials comparing resistive warming to forced-air warming made up the final sample. Four out of the five primary studies (80 %) concluded resistive warming was as effective as forced-air in the prevention of hypothermia in adult surgical patients in preventing hypothermia. Resistive warming offers additional benefits compared to forced-air and should be taken into consideration as an alternative warming method during the intra-operative and post-operative phases.<br>",TBD

Background: While college athletes generally have a good support system to minimize injury risk, recreationally active college students are on their own. A common prescreening test for athletes is the Y-Balance Test (YBT), which has been shown to be a good predictor of possible injury (Gonell, Romero, &amp; Soler, 2015). A difference of &gt; 4 cm between limb anterior reach is widely used as cutoff for determining risk of lower extremity injury (e.g., Plisky, Rauh, Kaminski, &amp; Underwood, 2006). No studies on injury risk were available in a non-athletic, non-professional population. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine the proportion of physically active college students at risk for a lower extremity injury as determined by the YBT. <br>
<br>
 Methods: Fifty-one moderately physically active college students (25F/26M, 21.3 ± 1.8 yrs), and without current injury participated. Participants performed the YBT by balancing on one leg whilst simultaneously reaching as far as possible with the other leg in three separate directions: anterior, posterolateral, and posteromedial. Reach distances for both legs were recorded, and a composite score was calculated. Data were analyzed using t-test between genders as well as between high-risk and low-risk groups.<br>
<br>
 Results: Composite score was 184.4 ± 17.6 cm, with no difference between genders. 21.5% of the participants demonstrated a &gt; 4 cm difference in anterior reach. When separated into high risk and low risk groups, anterior and posterolateral reach difference were significant (p &lt; 0.05). <br>
<br>
 Discussion: Approximately one in five students were determined to be at risk for a lower extremity injury. In order to minimize injury risk, these individuals should improve their stability, balance, and overall lower extremity strength before participating in sports involving pivoting, cutting, and jumping. Recreational centers could provide YBT testing and education on injury risk factors to their clientele. <br>",TBD

In the female, infertility is described as a state of being in which pregnancy cannot be initiated and/or maintained. In part, mammalian infertility may be attributed to abnormal development of an ovarian structure known as the corpus luteum (CL), which is responsible for maintaining pregnancy through secretion of progesterone. Aberrant development results in a decrease of progesterone production, which is associated with incomplete angiogenesis of the CL. Luteal angiogenesis requires the concerted regulation of many factors, including, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2), and angiopoietin-1 (Ang1). These factors are partly regulated by leptin, which appears to inhibit these pro-angiogenic factors in the early developing CL. Thus, leptin and its receptor (OB-Rb) are hypothesized to spatially and temporally fluctuate relative to CL development. Luteal tissue was paraffin embedded for immunohistochemical analysis from eleven mature gilts on days 4, 5, 6, and 7 of the estrous cycle (n=3 gilts/day). Leptin and OB-Rb were localized to vascular endothelial cells, cytosol, and/or membrane; concentration and location varied by day of development. Leptin significantly differed (P&lt;0.05) in the cytosol of luteal cells and in vascular endothelial cells relative to day. OB-Rb significantly differed (P=0.05) in the membrane and trended toward significance in the VEC by day. Additionally, leptin and OB-Rb significantly correlated (r2=0.68; P=0.005) in the membrane of luteal cells. Therefore, leptin and OB-Rb vary spatially and temporally in the developing CL, which concurs with spatial and temporal variation in previously reported angiogenic factors including FGF2.<br>",TBD

Shale oil extraction by hydraulic fracturing requires injection of high volumes of freshwater mixed with chemical additives. Produced water (PW) including all the liquid effluents that return to surface after fracking contains high levels of salts, fracking fluids oil residues, and other radioactive chemicals in the shale formation. Due to relatively facile operational process, membrane separation processes have become an emerging technology for the treatment of PW. Forward Osmosis (FO) has high salt rejections and can effectively remove total dissolved solids (TDS). Globally, high pressure Reverse Osmosis (RO) process has been the technology of choice for high salinity water desalination. The current study applies a hybrid FO-RO processes to treat PW from shale oil in Permian basin. Cellulose triacetate (CTA) FO membrane surfaces were modified by depositing poly amino acid 3-(3, 4-Dihydroxyphenyl)-L-alanine (L-DOPA), a zwitterionic polymer which enhanced the fouling resistance. Membrane fouling studies were conducted in pressure retarded osmosis (PRO) mode with alginic acid sodium salt (AAS) and calcium ions (CaCl2). The membranes were analyzed before and after coating using Attenuated Total Reflection Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy and Ultraviolet-Visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis). The water contact angles have been measured, and these results indicate the decrease of contact angles with increase in coating time. Coating with L-DOPA for a time of 12 h exhibited the best fouling resistance and was used in the treatment of shale oil PW. The effect of pre-filtration of PW from Permian basin through 0.45µm, 0.2µm and 0.1µm filters were evaluated and determined that pre-filtration with 0.1 and 0.2 µm yielded good results. The FO membrane recovery for pre-filtered PW through 0.45µm, 0.2µm and 0.1µm were found to be 67.8%, 76.9% and 78% respectively. The current study identifies optimum L-DOPA coating time and pre-filtration methods for PW treatment with a hybrid FO-RO process.<br>",TBD

 This research project is a continuation of research conducted by Onweni, Griffin, and Thomas (2017) that described the development of a quantitative measurement methodology to determine the concentration of Manganese Oxide (MnOx) on selected soil landscape positions (Uplands and Lowlands). A reaction between the MnOx in the soil sample and Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2) was initiated to determine the level of MnOx reactivity in the soil sample. The research design for the project focused on data collected from the four sites (Upland, Lowland, and two sites between the Uplands and Lowlands), within each site, five soil profile depths and three sample replicates measured which comprised a total of sixty (60) samples. A preliminary analysis of data collected from the four sites based on a comparison across all of the sites, using MnOx levels at each of the Geographic Site Locations, indicated that the Lowland (Site 4) had the highest level at the surface (5.94) followed by Site 3 at the surface with a value of (5.38) with the lowest value occurring at Site 2 with a value of (3.37). The present project is conducted to qualify the results of the initial study with an aim of the work being used to easily determine wetlands, the wetland boundary, and the movement of soluble MnOx ions within a soilscape. The delineation of the wetland boundary has both an economic and land-use importance to society, because of the importance of the ecological functions of wetland ecosystems.<br>",TBD

 According to the data published by the Economic Research Service (ERS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), per capita disappearance of wheat flour in the United States was 134.7 in 2014 (USDA-ERS, 2015). In fact that number has not undergone much change staying on average around 133 to 135 pounds for the past few years (USDA-ERS, 2015). On the supply side, the acreage for certified organic wheat has increased from 120,800 to 344,644 from 1995 to 2011, indicating the importance that is being placed on organically produced wheat (USDA-ERS, 2015). The ever increasing demand for organically produced products, the importance of flour as a top-five organically produced product (as a major ingredient for bread) in the United States, and the importance and opportunities that the USDA develops for expanding organic production of wheat (eventually leading to the expanded production of flour), create a need for a study that would investigate the household demand for organic and conventional flour.<br>
<br>
A probit model is estimated using the 2014 Nielsen Homescan panel data on household purchases to empirically analyze the influence of various socio-economic variables on the probability of households purchasing organic and conventional flour. A number of socio-economic variables are found statistically significant in terms of impacting the likelihood of buying organic and conventional flour.<br>
<br>
The successful completion of this study is significant in: (1) assisting interested parties in better understanding consumer demand behavior with respect to organic and conventional flour; (2) assisting flour manufacturers as well as wholesalers and retailers carrying this product in their pricing strategies; (3) helping to produce forecasts of sales of flour to facilitate inventory management for flour manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers; and (4) helping flour manufacturers in designing various marketing strategies geared towards specific demographic groups.<br>",TBD

More and more postsecondary institutions are joining the movement towards utilizing prior learning assessment (PLA) course-match portfolios to demonstrate and assess a student's experiential learning for college credit. As a result, these institutions are offering theory and practice courses for the purpose of assisting students in identifying experiential learning that may be equivalent to college-level knowledge. The theoretical foundation of these courses is Kolb's Experiential Learning Theory and Bloom's taxonomy; moreover, these models serve as a guideline in the assessment process to measure the complexity of skills within the learning narratives written by the student. Kolb proposed that an individual learner moves through a spiral initiated by the immediate experience and progressing to abstract observations and reflections on the experience (Kolb, 1984). Bloom's Taxonomy, which is used by educators across multiple disciplines, establishes a framework for defining and distinguishing different levels of thinking, learning, and understanding. The purpose of this practicum was to design a substantive educational online tutorial for the Prior Learning Assessment theory course at Texas A&amp;M University-Texarkana (TAMUT). In addition to providing an on-line option for delivery, course content was modified to transform the way in which students approach the reflective thought process needed to develop prior learning assessment portfolios. <br>
<br>
The result of this project was the development of eight learning modules for a 16-week course, incorporating active learning strategies and extensive instructor feedback, with the goal of students completing the “course-match portfolio” by the end of the fall term 2017. <br>",TBD

While the use of pegylated liposomes to encapsulate chemotherapeutics and serve as drug delivery systems has been an effective method in the treatment of a variety of cancers, one possible disadvantage is the lack of targeting capabilities to selectively bind cancerous versus non-cancerous cells. However, liposomes are readily modifiable to include targeting ligands, such as peptides, which specifically bind various upregulated cell surface receptors on cancer cells. One such receptor, the α3β1 integrin, is known to be overexpressed in metastatic breast cancer. In this study, we have incorporated a unique α3β1 Integrin Specific Targeting Peptide (ISα3β1TP) directly into the liposomal bilayer, which is known to bind this particular cell-surface receptor. Experiments were conducted to verify the presence of the peptide in the bilayer via absorbance spectroscopy followed by a series of stability studies to make sure the presence of the peptide did not negatively influence the integrity of the liposomes. The stability studies were conducted by measuring the leakage rates of the encapsulated fluorophore, rhodamine 6G, with respect to both temperature and time using a Tecan Infinite fluorescence plate reader (λexcitation = 525 nm and λemission = 555 nm). For example, the experiments were conducted at 4°C with both targeted and non-targeted liposomes for a period of thirty days, representative of long term shelf-life storage as well as 37°C for four days to represent physiologically relevant conditions. No significant difference in stability was observed in either system, suggesting we have successfully generated a stable system with potential targeting capabilities. We further quantified the relative fluorophore accumulation using fluorescence microscopy in both metastatic breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) as well as non-cancerous cells (MCF-10A) with targeted and non-targeted liposomes. We observed an increase in fluorophore accumulation in metastatic breast cancer cells compared to the non-cancerous cells, suggesting we have a selective system. <br>

 <b>ABSTRACT</b><br>
<br>
 After years of researching and publications on the rehabilitation of stroke survivors and working directly with the stroke survivors, Dr. Joe Priest, Professor of Kinesiology in the College of Education at Tarleton State University, has realized and believed that there are still hopes for these survivors to recover physically, to a certain degree, and psychologically as well as emotionally, to a large degree, from the strokes. Based on this belief, Dr. Priest established the Laboratory for Wellness and Motor Behavior (LWMB) and started working with Kinesiology “students whose focus is in allied health” to provide services to individuals “who have spinal cord injuries or other neurological disabilities” (LWMB 2016). <br>
<br>
 Using a team approach, the LWMB, under Dr. Priest's supervision, works closely with the patrons and their families, and the graduate assistants and interns from the Kinesiology Department. Even though relatively unknown to the general public, the Laboratory has been successful in helping the patrons and training the students. Nevertheless, in order to remain sustainable and to continuously “provide access to the benefits of exercise to those who otherwise are disregarded” (Priest 2016), a comprehensive marketing strategy is needed to help the LWMB warrant its “success and future expansion”. We will create a private institution for Dr. Priest's project called as “Last Chance ReHab” (LCR) and prepare a marketing plan for LCR.<b></b><br>
<br>
 There are four sections in this marketing plan. A situation analysis describing LCR's current situation is presented first, followed by a SWOT analysis assessing the influences the situation has on LCR's operations. Then, based on the analyses, a set of marketing objectives resulting from the recommendation are delineated. Finally, a new marketing strategy with specific marketing activities to accomplish the objectives is created. <br>",TBD

 <b>ABSTRACT</b><b></b><br>
<br>
 We investigated the effects biochar enriched with dairy wastewater on forage grass growth and soil fertility. The dairy wastewater enriched biochar for this study was the hardwood-derived biochar which was saturated with the lagoon effluents from Tarleton Dairy Farm. The sandy loam soil was mixed with different loading of biochars (raw biochar, dairy wastewater-enriched biochar; 0-8% in the soil by weight). The model forage grasses (Bermudagrass and Sorghum Sudan) were transferred to each pot and grown with regular watering in the greenhouse at Texas A&amp;M AgriLife Research Center at Stephenville, Texas. The growth of forage grasses was monitored at a regular interval (7 d) in terms of height and leaves. In overall, the growth of forage grasses increased with increasing loading of biochar for those with raw biochar and dairy wastewater-enriched biochar. In addition, there was better growth of forage grasses with the dairy wastewater –enriched biochar compared with those with raw biochar. While current findings support beneficial roles of biochar on plant growth as a slow release fertilizer, soil fertility and microbial community in each pot will be analyzed at the end of the pot experiments. The plant growth, soil fertility and microbial community with the addition of biochar will give us more understanding of biochar as alternative fertilizer to crops and grasses.<br>",TBD

 Snake venom contains an abundance of functionally distinct molecules. Among the non-enzymatic proteins, the C-type lectins (CTL) are of particular interest. A CTL is a calcium dependent, carbohydrate-binding protein that has a high specificity for sugar moieties. These proteins are capable of binding reversibly to glycoproteins found on the extracellular membrane, which modulate cell-to-cell interactions. Currently, two distinct groups of CTLs isolated from snake venoms are being investigated: true C-type lectins (TCLP) and C-type lectin-like proteins (CTL). Both the TCLP and CTL have been identified as having profound activity in the inhibition of cellular proliferation. Even more recently, CTLs isolated from other venoms, have gained recognition for possible antimicrobial effects against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The focus of this study is to isolate and characterize Hellericetin, a C-type lectin purified from the venom of <i>Crotalus oreganus helleri</i> (Southern Pacific Rattlesnake), and to determine its biological functionality on human endothelial cells <i>in vitro</i>.

 Drug delivery systems increase the therapeutic efficiency of the chemotherapeutic agent by controlling the rate at which the agent is released from the carrier to the systemic circulation or tissues, minimizing its interaction with non-pathological sites. Available delivery systems exhibit high toxicity. However, natural biomaterial polysaccharides are highly stable, non-toxic, hydrophilic, biodegradable, and abundantly available. These polysaccharides also have low manufacturing costs compared to current lipid-based and protein-based delivery systems. In the research so far, a non-toxic plant-derived drug delivery system has been developed. A series of tissue culture experiments have been performed to study the safety and toxicity of this polysaccharide-based drug-delivery system at varying doses in different cancer cell lines. The results have indicated that this drug-delivery system does not display toxicity in regards to <i>in vitro </i>studies. Additional research including <i>in vivo</i> mice models are performed to further study the safety and toxicity effects of the polysaccharide-based drug delivery system. The overall goal of the current research is to maximize the effectiveness of the chemotherapeutic agent when combined with the newly developed plant-based drug delivery system. Current research focuses on repeating and furthering the cell proliferation experiments to determine the most effective concentrations of the anti-cancer drug and plant-based drug delivery system. The results, although preliminary, are promising as we continue to experiment with different dosages. The current study is ongoing and is continuing to make progress. <br>",TBD

 The vast number of children placed in the Foster Care System, due to physical and sexual abuse, have higher rates for delinquency. Widom (1989), an empirical study on maltreatment and delinquency, indicates that most children who experience abuse have higher tendencies exhibiting both internal (fear, anxiety, and depression) and external (anger or violence) characteristics. Type of abuse (physical or sexual) and gender of the victim have a profound effect on which internal or external characteristics will be illicit. Placement in Foster Care tends to exacerbate delinquency. This study investigates the effects of abuse and foster care placement on delinquency. Secondary data from the Adoption and Foster Care Statistics (AFCARS) 2015 demonstrated positive correlations between abuse and foster care placement on delinquency. Implications of the study suggest that additional preventive measures are needed for children in the foster care system, that are removed from their permanent residence due to physical and sexual abuse.<br>",TBD

 The overall goal of this research is to develop a robotic arm that is readily available to assist in everyday personal and industry tasks. The arm will accomplish tasks based on the results of analyzing data from a scene using computer vision, voice commands from the user, and artificial intelligence algorithms that attempt to predict the user's behavior habits. Today's robots are being used in highly controlled environments which allows them to operate with very high precision. Our aim is to eventually develop an autonomous robotic arm that can operate in uncontrolled environments with the same level of accuracy and ease.
<br>
<br>
 Current work is being conducted with a robotic arm with two degrees of freedom and a design composed of high torque servos. The system is battery powered and can be operated from the Android Platform and a Bluetooth connection to an a microcontroller as well as with an Nvidia Jetson TX2 module. The arm consists of three actuated joints reaching a length of 45 cm. The arm comfortably can handle a 0.3 kg payload.

 As nations of the world including the United States face drastic depletion of surface fresh water, desalination of brackish groundwater and seawater emerges as one of the key water management strategies employed to meet the present and future water needs that can result from high population growth, rapid industrial developments and drought. Water recovery of reverse osmosis (RO) is usually kept at 50-80%, leading to significant volume of concentrate, and thus represents a loss of valuable water resources and poses major brine disposal challenge. In this study, membrane distillation (MD) is applied for the treatment of brackish RO concentrate to improve RO water recovery efficiency and reduce brine disposal. MD achieved 82.2% and 99.9% RO brine reduction and salt rejection, respectively, and added 13.2% to 84% of water originally recovered by RO resulting in total water recovery of 97.1%. Ultimately, MD shows great potential for high water recovery, salt rejection and brine reduction.

 Cancerous cells are cells that continue to divide uncontrollably in the body forming growth that are tumors. Cancerous cells are malignant and they spread into or invade nearby cells. The research objective is to develop alternative to known cancer treatment options that will selectively destroy cancer cells without compromising normal cells. The research will look into the fabrication of cation deficient copper(I) chalcogenides as plasmonic material in photo-thermal therapy for the destruction of cancer cells. The process involves the loading of this material into folic acid conjugated to heparin, where folic acid will look for and associate with foliate receptor sites common in most cancerous ability to find cancer cells, attach to the cancer cells and ablate the cancer cells when exposed to near infra-red light. The cation deficient copper (I) chalcogenides nanorods involve the solvothermal using copper (I) and, 1-dodocathiol and tert-dodocane thiol as thiol agent with adequtes control of the nucleation and growth temperature. The cation deficient copper (I) sulfide nanorods has been characterized using UV-Visible spectrometer, the powder x-ray diffraction was consistent with JDPDS file for a cation deficient copper (I) but slightly differs for a pure copper (I) nanocrystal, and SEM confirmed the nano-sized structure.

 Abstract<br>
<br>
 General social media statistics reveal that 2.5 billion people log in to social media daily (GlobalWebIndex, 2016). In this regard, social media has become more prominent among higher education's primary target audience; the most frequent internet users are teens and young adults between ages 12 and 29 years (Pew Research Center, 2010). Higher education institutions show increased interest in the potential of social media as a marketing tool to reach and attract future students (Constantinides &amp; Stagno, 2011). A key research theme in this field is marketing communications. A gap between the information that potential students want and the information provided by universities in their traditional forms of communications has been identified by past research (Hemsley-Brown &amp; Oplatka, 2006). The aim of this presentation is to inform higher education institutions on best practices to make better informed decisions when applying social networking tools. This presentation will provide an overview of the current social media and internet landscape, focusing on two prominent social media platforms: Facebook and Twitter. These leading social media sites are two out five that account for more than 1.84 billion active monthly users (Pew Research Center, 2010). Key strategies that will be covered include; how to manage campaign objectives, filter selection, media and content placement, and learning from campaign analytics. Using these tactics has allowed for a cost per click (CPC) reduction by over 1000% at our institution. Furthermore, analyzing campaign results in this project, suggests that social networking tools can help discover institution specific market segments, and has the ability to reach and build relationships with a specific target audience. This research presentation proposes new ways and ideas to enhance current social media networking strategies in higher education to optimize return on investment.<br>",TBD

<b>CFD Modelling of Raceway Photobioreactor's Dead Zone Using COMSOL Multiphysics for Optimum Biomass Production from Microalgae</b><br>
<br>
 There are challenges in using Raceway photobioreactor (RWP) for biomass production from microalgae due to its poor mixing and dead zone, which is area with velocity of less than 0.1 m/s, leading to low photoconversion efficiency as compared with the closed system photobioreactor. Thus, there have been different research works on various designs to improve its velocity of flow, mixing and biomass productivity. These include, the use of more than one paddle wheels, introduction of sloping baffles and flow deflectors. This research work was focused on the flow optimization using a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), COMSOL Multiphysics, to reduced dead zone and improve productivity of the reactor. The effects of variable number of flow baffles, central wall thickness, first channel diameter (distance between the first baffle and central wall), and ratio of first channel diameter to central wall thickness (Rin/Tw) on the percentage of dead zone were studied. The result showed that compared to control RWP, dead zone in the RWP with modified four baffles was decreased by 96.02% while the optimum ratio of Rin/Tw was found to be between 3 and 4.5.

<b>Abstract</b><b>:</b> Our research group is interested in the reactivity of the Oxo-surface pertaining to calix [5] arene towards active metal centers. The metal centers used for this project, are selected based on their catalytic properties. Our main goal is to selectively isolate a bimetallic calix [5] arene complex, and later study its possible reactive properties towards different substrates. We have proposed and devised different synthetic routes for the production of the bimetallic compound, in which we use four key reactions to guide our selective addition synthesis. Transmetallation, which is the replacement of an alkali metal cation with a transition metal from the d-block, Alkoxides, in which a metal-alkoxide deprotonates the calixarene, resulting in the direct addition of the desired transition metal, a transition metal-amide reaction, where a hydrogen on a calixarene is deprotonated by a metal-amide resulting in a similar addition described for a metal-Alkoxide, and the last reaction is using a silylated protected calixarene, in which the silyl group from the calixarene could be replaced by a transition metal or an addition of the transition metal can occur. In this presentation we will discuss our latest results that involve the study of Titanium-Palladium and Titanium-Silicon calixarene chemistry as two potential bimetallic compounds and its characterization using proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) as the main characterization tool. <br>",TBD

Egyptian spinach (<i>Corchorus spp.</i>) and vegetable amaranth (<i>Amaranthus spp</i>.) are popular nutritious tropical leafy vegetables with niche markets in the U.S. Therefore, growing these specialty vegetables successfully for the markets present requires determining suitable cultivars for the growing regions. Hence the goal of this study was to evaluate popular cultivars of Egyptian spinach and vegetable amaranth under the same field conditions to determine the most suitable cultivars for southeast Texas. This study included two Egyptian spinach cultivars: a Ghanaian cultivar and a cultivar bought from commercial sources. The five vegetable amaranth cultivars namely Red Garnet, Red Beauty, Red Leaf, All Red, and White Leaf were all acquired from commercial sources. Both vegetable crops were established on 1 m2 plots and grown to maturity before harvesting. For each of the vegetables SPAD readings, which is a measure of relative chlorophyll content, were taken for leaves from five randomly selected plants in each replicate before harvesting. Egyptian spinach was harvested three times while the amaranth was harvested only once. Analysis of variance of the fresh leaf yield data for Egyptian spinach showed that the cultivar obtained from a commercial source produced significantly (<i>p</i> = 0.0808) more leaves than the Ghanaian cultivar. Similar analysis of the SPAD readings showed no statistical difference. For the vegetable amaranth, the fresh leaf yield of the White Leaf cultivar was significantly different (<i>p</i> = 0.0071) from all the other cultivars. SPAD readings also showed significant differences (<i>p</i> &lt;0.0001) among the amaranth cultivars. The White Leaf variety had the lowest SPAD reading and Red Garnet the highest. The relationship between relative leaf chlorophyll content and yield was positive for Egyptian spinach and negative for vegetable amaranth. The results suggest that yield in combination with other desirable leaf attributes can be used to choose best varieties. <br>",TBD

 With this study, the researcher explored the relationship between hope in smokers who report wanting to quit and the variables stress and social support. More specifically, the researcher investigated to what extent variables of stress and social support affect hope in relation to smoking cessation efforts. The relationship between hope in smokers wanting to quit and the independent variables of stress and social support were analyzed by evaluating participant scores on the following measures: <i>Adult Dispositional Hope scale, Perceived Stress scale, Partner Interaction questionnaire</i>. This researcher used multiple regression analysis <i>(n = 202)</i> to explore the relationship between hope in smokers wanting to quit, perceived stress, and social support. An ANOVA analysis revealed a significant difference between overall perceived stress, social support, and hope. In particular, perceived negative support and perceived stress were found to significantly predict overall hope, whereas perceived positive support was not found to significantly predict levels of hope. The results of this study suggest that higher levels of perceived negative support and stress are associated with lower levels of hope.<br>",TBD

 Personal identification numbers (PINs) are a group of numeric codes created for the purpose of verification and security. PINs are widely used for user authentication for controlled access. PIN verification can be used in multiple applications from unlocking doors to phones. Manual password authentication using PINs requires users to physically input the PIN, which could be vulnerable to password cracking via shoulder surfing or thermal tracking, creating security problems when monitored and copied by unauthorized users.
<br>
<br>
 Gaze-based PIN entry offers a safer alternative that is more difficult to duplicate compared to manual PIN entry. Gaze-based PIN entry depends on eye-tracking technology to identify the location of the user's gaze, then correlating that location to a number on the PIN entry keypad. Eye-tracking involves monitoring eye movement and recording its location over time. By correlating gaze location to a keypad template as well as keeping track of temporal relationship between gaze transitions, PINs can be selected and identified by simply looking at digits or characters on the keypad; thus eye-tacking can be used for password authentication without the need for making physical contact with the keypad. 
<br>
<br>
 In this research, we describe hands-off gaze-based authentication by finding the user's eye location across sequential image frames, and tracking the eye center using a smart camera real time. The coordinates of the eye center are captured and saved in a writeable file on board the smart camera. The PIN is then determined by analyzing the data using MATLAB programming tool. We have been able to show that PINs can be identified successfully and consistently through clustering method. Stray data points appear during transitions between gazed digits and when the user moves his/her head or blinks. Such random errors are eliminated by analyzing both spatial and temporal information in the data set.

 Parenting students need resources and school accommodations for equal opportunities to remain in school and graduate. Roughly, 26%-30% of undergraduates enrolled in university and community college are parenting students (Students for Life of America, 2014). The Pregnant and Parenting Students Access to Education Act of 2015 requires each state to implement a plan to support parenting students. Also, as indicated in Title IX, all schools who receive federal finances are expected to provide equal opportunity for students to graduate. The quantitative study determines student body knowledge about services and the Title IX protections. The student researcher uses a survey with 12 questions that focus on the student body's knowledge of existing resources for parenting students. The survey also includes six demographic questions of age, classification, gender, major, marital status, and race. The student researcher uses purposive sampling to recruit 60 participants ages 18 and older who are classified as undergraduate and graduate students. Bourdieu's Cultural Capital (1986) recognizes individuals with more social capital are more successful in their accomplishments. The use of social resources greatly aids parenting students in their academic success (Brown &amp; Nichols, 2013). The hypotheses focus on the participants' wish for the university to convey information about parenting student resources. Results reveal whether female participants are more likely to know and use parenting student resources than male participants. Students who are knowledgeable about parenting resources can use them or allocate the information to parenting students. <br>",TBD

 Engineering programs in universities are consistently reporting low student retention rates yet research into this problem is limited. In this research the effectiveness of an interactive, student-driven, learning supplement is investigated through questionnaires distributed to participating engineering students at Texas A&amp;M University-Commerce. The learning supplements, consisting of three key example problems from mechanics classes, including a beam and a truss subjected to selected loadings, were developed in SolidWorks. The goal of this research is the demonstration of the effectiveness of integrating learning supplements for student success in the Engineering Mechanics class of the Engineering programs at Texas A&amp;M University-Commerce. The success of this experiment could increase the retention rate for the program as well as the level of student readiness upon graduation. <br>

 Central Texas development has increased greatly in recent years, but perhaps the most significant is the acquisition and development of the newest campus to the Texas A&amp;M University System. The Texas A&amp;M University - Central Texas (TAMUCT) campus, approximately 272 hectares, is an area characteristic of the Blackland Prairie and Cross Timbers ecological regions. Though these ecoregions have had increasing urbanization, each offers a range of plant and wildlife diversity. <br>
 <br>
 Over the last two years, this multi-year biodiversity field study was conducted at TAMUCT resulting in a baseline description of the campus flora, measure of flora biodiversity, and classification of soil textural class. Using random sampling methods from 15 various field sites, six soil textural classes were determined and seven plant families were identified as Asteraceae, Cupressaceae, Fabaceae, Fagaceae, Lamiaceae, Poaceae, and Rhamnaceae. Noteworthy species included the recently recorded <i>Dalea tenuis </i>and <i>Ziziphus obtusifolia</i> which had not been recorded in Bell County prior to this survey. <br>

 Bilingual education has been studied by many historians due to past conflicts brought on by both sides of the political aisle. However, these studies have either looked at the effects of bilingual education as a political phenomenon or have focused on bilingual education's effect on limited English proficient (LEP) students. The purpose of this study is to research the effects bilingual education has had on non-LEP students by expanding Dr. Aimee Chin's theory of a spillover effect into a visual one. This will be done by providing a narrative that interprets data and a background history on bilingual education in the Rio Grande Valley. With data gathered from Brownsville Independent School District, the Texas Education Agency, and various interviews, results uncovered various benefits. Overall, results show that three mechanisms–school resource allocation, the quality of teachers, and teaching methods used in all classrooms–cause a spillover effect that non-LEPs students benefit from as the same time LEP students received a quality bilingual education.

 Biomass has been a potential feedstock for generation of clean energy for nearly 100 years. Pyrolysis is one of several thermos-chemical processes that can be used to convert biomass to syngas, charcoal, and bio-oils. However, pyrolysis typically involves a large number of reactions that generate a complicated product distribution. Development of practical pyrolysis-based processes requires quantitative models for the reaction pathways and the associated reaction kinetics as a starting point for rational process design. <br>
<br>
 Rio Red grapefruit grown in South Texas is a candidate for pyrolytic conversion since it produces <i>ca. </i>40 to 50 wt. % of solid waste. Exploratory pyrolysis experiments were performed using citrus waste as a biomass feed stock in separate experiments as a first step toward understanding the reaction pathways and kinetics. A CDS Analytical Series 5200 Pyroprobe was used to pyrolyze the biomass samples. The initial results show that conducting the pyrolysis in the absence or presence of a zeolite-based catalyst leads to the positive identification of a variety of furan, furfural, and aromatic organic molecules containing a range of functional groups. The challenges associated with development of a pyrolysis-based bio-refinery are also discussed.<br>

Stereotypes help us quickly make sense of the world by allowing us to categorize people into groups to then make assumptions about them based off this group membership According to Social Role Theory, stereotype biases are formed by observing gender disparities in social roles and are modified by encounters with individuals in counter-stereotypic positions. Despite prominent counter-stereotypic exemplars in our current day, a persistently common bias is to rate men as more competent than comparable females. The Hispanic culture in particular seems to hold more strongly to gender biases. In this study, we examined implicit pro-male bias by having Hispanic female participants interact with a either a male or female Hispanic confederate, in either a superior (i.e., PhD student) or peer social status (i.e., undergraduate student). Additionally, incoming students and long-term student cohorts provided a test of stereotype bias modification due to prolonged exposure to counter-stereotypic exemplars which are frequent at a Hispanic-serving institute (HSI) environment. Stereotypic male-competent implicit biases were measured through the Implicit Association Test and indicate a trending interaction between confederate gender and both student cohort group and confederate status. Specifically, the data shows a trend of a magnified reduction in pro-male bias when participants interacted with a female compared to a male confederate in the long-term cohort, who have had greater duration of exposure to counter-stereotypic exemplars while attending an HSI. Additionally, data trends suggest that interactions with a confederate in the superior social status position magnify the differences in pro-male bias scores for male versus female confederate experiences, such that the female confederate in a superior position precipitates the lowest pro-male bias scores. <br>

 As new technologies arise and the fields of science expand, there has grown a greater interest in the field of catalysts. Many catalysts that have been developed have contained metallic activity sites. This has drawn our research group to explore the chemical properties of metallo-calixarene complexes. A calixarene is composed of multiple phenol rings connected by methylene bridges in order to form a macrocyclic complex. The hydroxyl groups from the phenol rings make up an oxo-surface to which metals can bind, which has drawn our attention to these compounds. Our research with these compounds has been synthesizing bimetallic calixarene complexes containing two different transition metals using a multiple methods including transmetallation, metal alkoxides, metal amides, and silylation. We characterize our synthesized compounds using melting point, IR (infrared spectroscopy), and 1H-NMR (proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy). In our current research, we are studying Nickel(II) calixarenes and its reactivity with specific ligands. Eventually we would like to obtain crystals of these synthesized complexes so they can be characterized by x-ray spectroscopy.

 Tracking objects in video is a hot topic of research because of its application to the solution of advanced security and surveillance problems. There are two major ways to initialize the process of tracking: the user manually selects the targets in the beginning of the tracking process or the method makes the selection. In the cases where the method makes the selection, three different techniques are applied for moving target detection. All three techniques are based off foreground detection methods where the background is modeled by frame differencing, mean filter, or median filter. The goal of the background modeling process is to create an image with the foreground objects removed. For this purpose, we determine if the absolute value of the difference between the background image and present frame is greater than or less than the user-defined threshold. Through this process, foreground objects are portrayed as white and background images are portrayed as black. The final step in the process is called data validation in which we apply the opening morphological operator to remove any noise not related to the foreground. In the presentation, we will provide details about each of the techniques along with a number of experimental results. The presentation will conclude with a comparison between the three methods and discussion on their utilities. <br>

 We are investigating the interactions between metal cofactors and various Amino Acids to prepare a metal complex. We first crystallize amino acids binding to a metal cofactor using the 1st method. Then such crystal was studied through UV-vis, IR, NMR, and X-ray diffraction. We found that the amino acids weren't attached to the metal. With further research, we were able to find another method, 2nd one to prepare the metal complex, using sodium carbonate. Also, to further advance our understanding of the interactions between the metal cofactor and amino acids, we combined lab work and computational work. In fact, we use density functional theory (DFT) to predict the UV vis spectrum of these complexes. Such study can provide us the subtle changes due to the different metal cofactors, especially the d-orbital of metal and valence orbitals of amino acids.<br>

In the Lower Rio Grande Valley of south Texas, mourning doves nest in both citrus and remnant woodland land covers, both of which are decreasing in the region. The objectives of this study were to compare nest survival between citrus and woodland land covers and to model the influence of habitat characteristics on nest survival. In 2016, we located 100 nests in four citrus groves (<i>n</i> = 21) and two woodlots (<i>n</i> = 79) in Hidalgo and Cameron Counties, Texas. We monitored nests every three days and collected nest site vegetation measurements. We used logistic-exposure and AIC model selection to determine which environmental and temporal variables predicted nest survival. Candidate models included temporal variables and nest concealment variables such as overhead cover, side cover, distance to foliage edge, and density of vegetation below the nest. Daily survival rate was higher in citrus sites (0.972) than woodland sites (0.946). We determined that predation was the primary reason for nest failure. Density of vegetation below the nest was the best predictor of survival (AICcWt = 0.17) and had a positive influence. Land cover type was the next supported model (AICcWt = 0.12). The conversion of citrus agriculture to urban areas and row cropping should trouble wildlife managers in the region. Breeding mourning dove populations may be impacted by the extreme loss of citrus groves and woodlands that has occurred during the last 50 years. <br>",

Theoretically, the study uses the value chain as an organizational model to identify different business activities. Methodologically, a mixed methods approach will be taken to link social media activities to value chain segments. First, posts of small businesses that use social media will be linked to value chain segments. Second, a survey will be conducted to identify which segments of the value chain businesses plan to use social media for. The mixed methods approach will allow for a comparison of which activities small businesses are planning to use social media for and which processes the businesses are using social media for.

 Pure erythroid leukemia (PEL) is a rare and aggressive cancer with unknown etiology. Since cytokine signals control hematopoietic stem cell proliferation and differentiation, we hypothesized that the cytokine independent survival and proliferation of erythroid progenitor cells is crucial for PEL development. To test this hypothesis, a novel cytokine-independent subline, UT-7/EI, was developed from erythropoietin (Epo) dependent erythroleukemic progenitor cell line UT-7/Epo. The UT-7/EI cells survived without Epo and formed aggregates as they proliferated, suggesting augmented cell-cell adhesion. In agreement with this, differential gene expression and network analysis uncovered the enrichment of E-cadherin (CDH1) mediated homotypic cell-cell adhesion pathway in UT-7/EI cells. The upregulation of CDH1 mRNA and protein was further validated using qRT-PCR (p &lt; 0.01) and immunoblot analysis respectively. In confocal imaging studies, E-cadherin-β-catenin adhesion complexes were concentrated at adherence junctions of UT-7/EI cells. Moreover, calcium chelation abrogated cell-cell adhesion and induced cell death of UT-7/EI cells. To further understand the cytokine-independent survival of UT-7/EI, CDH1 regulation by Epo was investigated. In kinetic studies, Epo suppressed CDH1 expression in UT-7/EI cells at 24, 48, and 72 hrs with a corresponding increase in SNAIL2 expression, a repressor of CDH1 transcription (p &lt; 0.01). Consequently, Epo abrogated the cellcell adhesion of UT-7/EI cells without affecting their viability. These results suggest that CDH1 and Epo dependent survival pathways are mutually exclusive. In CFU-GEM assay, UT-7/EI cells formed erythroblast like colonies with positive heme staining and high CD36 expression (3.22- fold relative to UT-7/Epo), a marker of immature erythroblasts in PEL. In summary, our study identified a role for CDH1 mediated cell-cell adhesion pathway in developing cytokineindependence in PEL. Therefore, suppression of CDH1 mediated homotypic cell-cell adhesion may improve therapeutic outcomes in cytokine-independent PEL.<br>

 In the food animal industry, the administration of antibiotics to swine is important for the prevention, control, and treatment of disease. Previous studies suggest that the use of antibiotics in the food animal industry has contributed to the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria. In addition, antibiotics may induce selective pressures on the gut microbiota of swine, potentially affecting their overall health. The objective of this study was to observe alterations in the intestinal microbiome of grower swine, challenged with multi-drug resistant (MDR) and pan-susceptible 
<i>Salmonella spp.</i>, in response to treatment with chlortetracycline and/or ceftiofur. Community DNA from swine fecal samples was extracted using the QIAamp DNA stool mini kit and QIAcube automated platform. 16S Metagenomics Sequencing Libraries were prepared using the recommended Illumina protocol. Sequencing was performed on the Illumina MiSeq, and output data was analyzed using the 16s Metagenomic application on Illumina Basespace, Explicet software, and Stata. The most prevalent microbiota found from bacterial libraries were from the families Prevotellaceae, Ruminococcaceae, Veillonellaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Clostridiaceae, respectively. Significant differences in microbial communities were found between day four and day eighteen libraries, as well as libraries between the control and combined chlortetracycline-ceftiofur treatment group. Knowledge on the impact of how antibiotics affect the bacterial populations in swine contributes to the understanding of the potential impacts to swine health. Furthermore, comprehending the length of time at which antibiotics affect gut microbiota can aid in decision-making about antibiotic treatment options. <br>

 Previous research has shown that students are neither formally educated nor trained to understand global dynamics, trends, systems and make informed decisions with full knowledge or awareness of global implications. However, a survey carried out by The American Association of Colleges and Universities (AAC&amp;U) showed that employers expect educational institutions to produce globally competent college graduates capable of functioning in today's highly interconnected world in addition to the knowledge and skills gained in their various fields. Hence, educational institutions have been charged and challenged to prepare and produce globally competent college graduates. Hunter (2004) defined global competence as “having an open mind while actively seeking to understand cultural norms and expectations of others, and leveraging this gained knowledge to interact, communicate and work effectively in diverse environments"" (p. 81). The Global Competency Aptitude Assessment (GCAA) model is an instrument used to capture an individual's capacities of global knowledge, skills, attitudes and experiences through eight dimensions divided into two major areas of competence - internal readiness, consisting of self-awareness, open-mindedness, attentiveness to diversity, and risk taking; and external readiness, consisting of historical perspective, global awareness, intercultural capability, and collaboration across cultures. In an effort to explore these dynamics, this exploratory study assesses the global competence of graduating students' (n=15) who took the GCAA in their freshman year, were exposed to experiences and events on and off campus that aimed to prepared them for an interconnected world and have taken the assessment again upon graduation. Using descriptive statistics, this study will serve as an early review to discover factors responsible for improved global competence among these students who joined the university as first-time, full-time freshmen. Also, it will provide insight on what to expect from students who have been immersed in an environment that encourages global activities as a major factor in increasing an individual's global competence.

 Over the past two decades, a new class of purely organic, metal-free catalysts has emerged for use in asymmetric reactions. These organocatalysts are beneficial not just for providing new opportunities for development, but are also generally stable and simple to synthesize. Natural products and their derivatives have specifically shown great promise in catalytic ability and are especially favorable due to the ease of obtaining them. Among these, the amino acid L-proline has emerged as a particularly useful organocatalyst in several reaction mechanisms. Numerous L-proline derivatives have been designed and synthesized and their catalytic abilities tested. Herein, one such L-proline derivative, diarylpyrolinol silyl ether, was synthesized and screened in combination with benzoic acid as a catalyst for an asymmetric [3 + 2] cycloaddition of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes and 3-hydroxyoxindoles in aqueous media. The reaction afforded the desired products spirocyclic δ-lactones bearing two vicinal stereogenic centers in good to high yields with high enantioselectivity under mild reaction conditions.<br>

 Students with autism are assumed to be good in mathematics, and there has been research done that supports this assumption when students are in the early elementary grades (Titeca, Roeyers, Josephy, Ceulemans, &amp; Desoete, 2014). However, as the material becomes more abstract in the higher levels, math is a difficult subject for students with Autism to learn (Mayes &amp; Calhoun, 2003; Whitby &amp; Mancil, 2009). More students are falling on the Autism Spectrum in general education classrooms (Sansoti &amp; Powell-Smith, 2008). Further, teachers are not equipped to teach students with autism mathematics, causing the students to have a disadvantage in a general education classroom. As more students on the autism spectrum are diagnosed and transition to high school mathematics, mathematics teacher educators must prepare to support in-service and pre-service classroom teachers to meet the needs of these students. I will conduct a multiple baseline single- subject design. This design is to evaluate the outcomes of individuals instead of groups and compares the effects of different conditions on individuals. First I will collect observation data by watching how the two participants (a pair of twins) perform mathematics. Then I will predict what I expect to see during and after the intervention. The observation and predications will serve as the baseline measures. After I have created a stable baseline, I will then introduce my intervention which includes the use of smart pens and graphic organizers. I will collect data and store it on an encrypted flash drive to maintain confidentiality. I will record my data in a chart or graph and then I will discuss my findings.<br>

 The expense of production and distribution of antivenom, as well as relatively infrequent use compared to other medications, has caused antivenom against snakebite to be increasingly difficult to obtain, ultimately producing an alarming global shortage. Unused, expired antivenom may represent a large, untapped resource to ameliorate this crisis. This study examines the efficacy of expired antivenom over time using whole blood clotting statistics <i>in vitro</i>. Representatives from three years for four different brands of polyvalent antivenom were chosen and tested against their corresponding venoms as well as other venoms that could display cross reactivity. These include: Wyeth (U.S.; 1997, 2001, 2003), Antivipmyn (Mexico; 2005, 2013, 2017), Biotecfar (Venezuela; 2010, 2014, 2016), and SAIMR (South Africa; 1997, 2005, 2017). The species tested include: <i>Crotalus atrox</i> venom against Wyeth; <i>C. atrox</i> and <i>C. durissus vegrandis</i> against Antivipmyn; <i>C. atrox</i>, <i>C. d. vegrandis</i> and <i>Bothrops colombiensis</i> against Biotecfar, and <i>Bitis gabonica</i> against SAIMR. Variables recorded were activated clotting time (ACT), clotting rate (CR), and platelet function (PF). Preliminary results appear encouraging; the antivenoms maintained efficacy over the various time spans. In light of the global shortage of antivenom, this information will provide hope in the cases of snakebite emergencies. <br>

</strong><br>
 The influence of maturity on success is of great interest to everyone, especially parents. Indeed parents often wonder whether their 5-year old child, who was born in August of 2012, will advance as quickly as a 5-year old child, who was born in September of 2011. Moreover, research suggests that such relative age differences influence success in physical activities (e.g. Musch &amp; Grondin, 2001) and possibly academic achievement (e.g. Navarro, Garcia-Rubio, &amp; Olivarer, 2015). However, little is known about the influences of maturity (as measured by relative age differences) on cognitive skills, especially those cognitive skills that are important with reading development. The goal of this study is to determine whether relative age differences influence the key cognitive skills that are important for reading development.<br>

Introduction:<br>
<br>
Some studies conducted on military recruits point to the possibility of body mass, aerobic fitness, and activity levels of recruits being risk factors in musculoskeletal injuries in the military recruits. The Army has recently implemented a program called the Performance Triad which includes sleep, activity, and nutrition. It is thought that if a person has all three aspects of this triad then they will be a better soldier and be less likely to get hurt. This study will look at sleep, activity, and BMI to determine if any relation exists between these factors and performance improvement. This study is needed to support the theory of implementing the Army's Performance Triad. We hypothesize that recruits who are getting adequate sleep, maintaining reasonable activity levels, and a decrease in body mass will progress faster in their performance levels than their compatriots. <br>
<br>
Statistical Analysis:<br>
<br>
Analysis of results will present each component (sleep, body mass, HR during activity, average steps per day) will be correlated with amount of improvement in a cadet's physical performance.<br>",TBD

 Latinos in the United States are the largest and fastest growing minority group, with about 55.4 million people (Grieco, 2010). Since 1993, there has been an increase in Latino college enrollment of about 201%, which is correlated to the growth in population (Krogstad, 2015). Research has shown that among individuals of the ages 18 to 25, dating violence (DV) victimization within intimate relationships appears to be significantly higher (Black et. al., 2011). Fragoso and Kashubeck (2000), state increasing evidence supports the view that the way males are traditionally socialized to be masculine might have deleterious mental and physical health consequences. Some researchers propose that male dominance and female submission, which are strongly engrained in traditional gender beliefs, generate an unequal balance of power between genders, which then increases the likelihood for abusive behaviors (Ulloa, Jaycox, Skinner, &amp; Orsburn, 2008). The purpose of this study is to explore the impact of cultural factors and its influence on attitudes and beliefs towards dating violence among male Latino college students. A qualitative study was conducted with 10 male Latino student participants attending a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI). 10 in-depth interviews were conducted by graduate research assistants using an interview protocol that lasted between 40-50 minutes. Data analysis was conducted using the qualitative software Atlas.ti. We predict that Latino males who identify more with the traditional culture roles are more likely to view certain dating beliefs and behaviors as non-violent and culturally appropriate. <br>

 The properties of plant based polymers were observed and compared to the properties of polyacrylamide, a synthetic polymer, by means of experimentation. When polyacrylamide degrades in the environment it turns into acrylamide, a substance linked to birth defects, cancer in animals, and nerve damage. The purpose of these experiments was to discover the maximum crude oil removal of several biopolymers and compare the result with polyacrylamide to estimate the practical application of biopolymers removing crude oil from ocean surface water. Crude oil was injected into several different containers of water and each treated with a different polymer (polyacrylamide, fenugreek, or psyllium) or used as a control group then the percent oil removal was calculated. The biopolymers, fenugreek and psyllium, were able to surpass the crude oil sorption of polyacrylamide but the maximum efficiency of each polymer was not discovered in the experiments conducted. Further experiments will be needed to establish the maximum efficiency of each polymer in removing crude oils from ocean surface waters. <br>

 White-winged dove (
<i>Zenaidia asiatica</i>, WWDO) populations have expanded over the last few decades and are associated with urban environments more than rural ones (81.2% and 18.8%, respectively; TPWD 2015). Given their importance as a game species, TPWD expanded monitoring efforts in 2008 to provide a statewide Urban Dove Survey (UDS). Objectives of this study are to assess the population trends of WWDO at the city level as well as to provide an updated urban dove population estimate for 2016. To accomplish this, we used the Conventional Distance Sampling Engine (CDS) in Program DISTANCE 7.0 to quantify densities at the city level. We truncated observation data at 100 m to reduce the effects of outliers and selected models using Akaike Information Criteria corrected for small sample size (AICc). We performed a Multiple Response Permutation Procedure using banding and recovery data to identify subpopulations of WWDO in Texas. We modeled detection functions based on these subpopulations to attain density and abundance estimates by city. Analyses indicate that, predictably, the greatest increases in WWDO populations by city occurred in the ecoregions that had the most population growth over the survey period: Post Oak Savannah, Cross Timbers, and South Texas. Additionally, larger cities and those undergoing rapid urban development over the survey period (i.e. San Marcos, Denton) also experienced larger WWDO density increases (0.217 birds/ha 2008, 4.387 birds/ha 2015; 0.327 birds/ha 2008, 2.087 birds/ha 2015, respectively) as opposed to more rural towns. Knowledge of fine scale population trends of WWDO will allow us to address survey effort issues going forward. Routes within the UDS will likely need to be altered to make the survey as efficient as possible by allocating resources towards WWDO population centers.<br>

 The fast development of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) will transform our next generation of transportation systems. Such new technologies are capable of reducing human errors and providing real-time information to vehicles and infrastructure systems. The existing driving environment and traffic management policies are expected to be challenged by blending CAVs with regular vehicles. This research examines the potential benefits of CAVs by performing comprehensive case studies. We focus on three major areas: safety, fuel efficiency, and mobility. We further assess the influence of CAVs on drivers' behavior and existing traffic management policies and propose future research directions. A simple agent-based simulation model is built to model the movement of shared autonomous vehicles during peak hours and non-work hours in a grid network. We compare the efficiency of this system and individuals' travel times with the regular traffic system. Our modeling results reveal the improvement in congestion reduction for shared autonomous vehicles. The policy implications of adopting CAVs on vehicle sharing are further discussed and evaluated. <br>

 <b>Background:</b> There has been increasing attention on healthy eating among families and the general population. Healthy People 2020 has recommended possible approaches to promoting healthy home prepared meals. Only few nutrition interventions have addressed some aspects of food preparation such as cooking and meal planning. Therefore, the extent to which parents are teaching and engaging their children in food preparation literacy is not well established. The purpose of this study was to gain knowledge on how the parents transfer food preparation literacy to their children. <b>Methods:</b> Rural parents were recruited through flyers to participate in a semi-structured interview. Each parent was asked to explain their formal and informal food preparation training. The interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. <b>Result:</b> Four parents participated in the interview and self-identified as African-American (N=3) and Caucasian (N=1). The data analysis revealed three broad categories: first, food preparation skills were transmitted through direct encouragement and engagement; second, parents' primary method of learning food preparation came from parents and grandparents; and third, different types of food (corn, baked chicken, and beef) were being prepared at home. <b>Conclusions</b>: This study provides a foundation to understand food preparation practices in the home. Future research will be needed to explore other cultural practices related to food preparation literacy. <br>

 <b>Abstract: </b>Mottled ducks (<i>Anas fulvigula</i>) are non-migratory waterfowl dependent upon coastal marshes, such as those along the Texas Gulf Coast. Populations on the upper Texas coast have experienced long-term declines due to factors such as urban development, changes in land use, and low nesting success. Considering these declines our objectives were (1) determine survival and recovery estimates for mottled ducks on the J.D. Murphree WMA, and (2) examine the influence of rainfall on mottled duck reproductive success. We analyzed bandings (n = 5,666) and recoveries (n = 832) from 2004–2015 on the J.D. Murphree WMA. We used Program MARK to generate survival and recovery estimates by age and sex. To analyze rainfall as an influencing factor, we ran linear and quadratic regression models in Program R, using the proportion of hatch year (HY) birds banded as an index of reproductive success. We found that survival and recovery vary by age and sex. Recovery estimates by age and sex class were 0.05 for AHY females, 0.06 for AHY males, 0.08 for HY females, and 0.11 for HY males. Survival estimates by age and sex class were 0.49 for AHY females, 0.64 for AHY males, 0.39 for HY females, and 0.53 for HY males. Total rainfall during peak nesting season showed a weak negative relationship (-0.0085, 95% CI: -0.024, 0.007), and was our only competitive model besides the null. As expected, our survival and recovery estimates varied by age and sex. Due to the lack of competitivity in models, we see that our three measures or rainfall are not adequate predictors of reproductive success in mottled ducks. <br>

 <b>Abstract</b>: Saved by Charles Goodnight and his wife during the 1800s, the Texas State Bison herd in Caprock Canyons State Park, Briscoe County, TX, is the only remaining herd of southern plains bison (<i>Bison bison bison</i>). Research has found that this herd has three unique genetic markers not found in the DNA of other bison herds in North America. Texas Parks and Wildlife has been working on the stability and success of the herd; their work includes restoration of the native prairie using prescribed burns and chemical deterrents. In February 2017, we placed four GPS collars on bred females around 3 years of age. We set the collars to take fixes every two hours and upload twice daily. We are using remote sensing data and field data to measure slope, distance to permanent water, woody coverage, rangeland productivity and plant composition, and human disturbances. We will use an information-theoretic approach and Akaike's Information Criterion adjusted for small sample sizes (AICc) to identify models that best predict the data. In addition, we will create a Rangeland Suitability Model. Our model will result in a grid map depicting probability of use as a percentage for each cell. Our study will help TPWD understand available areas of use, which in turn will help us evaluate an ecological carrying capacity for the state park and proposed areas for future restoration.<br>

 <a name=""_gjdgxs""></a>Parentification is a role-reversal phenomenon between parents and their children. This means that there are inappropriate boundary violations occurring such as children being the physical or emotional caretakers of their parents (e.g. cooking meals, caring for the welfare of siblings, providing an emotional outlet for their parents' problems, etc.). Studies have shown that childhood parentification can produce negative effects, such as anxiety and depression (e.g. Hooper et. al., 2011; Williams &amp; Francis, 2010), but locus of control moderates the relationship between parentification and depression and happiness (Williams &amp; Francis, 2010). The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between parentification and anxiety and if locus of control influences that relationship in regards to father-daughter dyads, as this dyad is under-represented in the current parentification literature. Female participants completed the Parentification Questionnaire (Jurkovic &amp; Thirkield, 1998), the Levenson Multidimensional Locus of Control Inventory (LMLOC; Levenson, 1973), the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-42; Lovibond &amp; Lovibond, 1993), and a demographic questionnaire.

 The popular figure of the Wicked Witch of the West has drastically transformed from the time of her conception as a villain, and into modernity, where she is seen in a more humanlike manner. In MGM's The Wizard of Oz (1939) based on the book by L. Frank Baum, the character is an unnamed, power hungry villain, intent on getting revenge on the innocent protagonist, Dorothy. As feminism moved forward and revisionism gained popularity, Gregory Maguire's novel Wicked: Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West gave this character a name, Elphaba, and a purpose. She fought for the freedom of the Animals, and although her cause was noble, she was seen as wicked by her society because she was in direct opposition to the patriarchy, the Wizard of Oz. This development from a clear-cut villain into a woman who was fighting for her cause was only expanded upon when the popular musical Wicked debuted, and the once villain became a role model, especially for adolescent and teenage girls. The character went from one extreme to another, until ABC's recent TV series Once Upon a Time portrayed her as a more complex, interesting, and morally ambivalent individual, not entirely good nor entirely evil. Through an analysis of this significant transformation, we can see how the character of the Wicked Witch reflects the expectations society placed, and continues to place, on women.<br>

<br>
 As the culture of humanity has progressed, many examples continue to appear of individuals being assigned labels because their actions are deemed improper by the ruling society of an era. From the time of ancient Greece to the present age, these labels are given to any character that deviates from what is perceived to be “normal” behavior and instead works against the grain of society. Two major examples of this attribution can be seen in the character of Lysistrata and Lara Croft, two women of vastly different time periods who share the common trait of being well known for not following their assigned womanly roles and instead fulfilling their own life wishes at the cost of being given the title of “bad girl.” <br>
<br>
 In this analysis, I will be using feminist criticism to examine both the modern-day character of Lara Croft from the Tomb Raider franchise and the ancient Greek character Lysistrata in order to compare the traits that each woman has that categorizes her as a type of “bad girl” in the modern era. Through this research, I hope to draw attention to the stereotypes and labels given to women in fiction and popular culture and show how these perceived attributes can be interpreted as both a hindrance and a benefit to the image of women. <br>

 Abstract:
</strong> The progress of biomedical science depends on the availability of tools and instruments capable of analyzing biological systems in their natural environment without disturbing their behavior. Advanced optical characterization techniques, such as Raman spectroscopy, are powerful non-invasive and non-destructive means for obtaining the chemical properties of materials with applications in several fields including agriculture, chemistry, medicine, and materials science. By tailoring the properties of nanomaterials, a wide range of new biomedical applications including remote temperature sensing with existing chemical identification and imaging techniques has become available. I will present the design and outline of an optical system that I helped to develop during this summer. This system tests the suitability of a smart substrate composed of a newly engineered temperature sensitive water-based biocompatible core/shell up-conversion nanoparticle (UCNP) for remote temperature sensing. Future applications of this optical imaging system will be discussed as well.<br>",

 The academic objective of this research is to design a motor control system that can vary the output speed of a given motor using a raspberry pi. The motor control is driven by an electronic system consisting of multiple sensors, electronic devices and a power supply, which can monitor performance through a touch screen display. <br>
<br>
 A motor control example in real-world is represented in modern-day gasoline vehicles. Gasoline vehicles regulate the motor control by the input force applied to the gas pedal which then opens the throttle valve air intake and interacts with a mass air force sensor, mass air pressure sensor, throttle position sensor, and an O2 sensor. All of these sensors communicate with the vehicles' computer system which then allows gasoline to flow into the engine based on an air-to-gas conversion ratio. Air-to-gas ratio determines the amount of energy to be applied to engine which then transfers this energy to the motor. <br>
<br>
 This scientific research project reduces the amount of labor needed to regulate motor control by utilizing a pressure resistive sensor and an encoder that could output real-time information into a microprocessor which could then actuate the speed of the motor. Thus far a PID code has been implemented into a windows IOt operating system and UI service created that the user could use to monitor and interact with the computer system. This system could be replicated on an industrial level which could do more than just power a motor; the system could be implemented in automobiles, rockets and even more future electronics that could pave the way for power and energy electronics used in everyday events.<br>

 Frailty and sarcopenia are risks associated with functional decline of aging. Longevity research is now focused on extending health span for individuals, the period of time that aging adults are free of chronic diseases such as these. A possible intervention that may increase health span is the drug rapamycin which has been found to significantly increase life span in mice. In order to determine whether rapamycin may increase health, locomotion and balance are being examined in marmosets (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>), a New World primate. Marmosets are a good model for aging studies due to their short average lifespan of four to six years. To test whether rapamycin protects aging marmosets from functional decline in locomotion and balance, we examined ambulation of the marmosets in an open field. Twenty marmosets have been receiving daily doses of oral rapamycin in a yogurt vehicle for over one year. The open field apparatus measured six foot by six foot, gridded by one foot marks, enclosed along the exterior with a two-foot barrier. Marmosets were trained to transfer into a cylinder from their cage and then into a ferret ball. For the trial the ferret ball was placed into the open field and data collection included location within the field each 20 seconds, and number of grid line crossings collected instantaneously. In the preliminary two minute trials marmosets regardless of age and rapamycin status varied between very active and inactive. In the lengthened four minute trials half of the marmosets doubled in line crossing, as well as varying in position and balance inside the ball itself.

 Shin splints account for 60% of exercise-induced lower leg pain and are the most common overuse injury of the lower leg (Herring, 2006). Currently, the research has not provided any significant preventative techniques for this injury. The purpose of this study is to implement an exercise program aimed at preventing the onset of medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS) by strengthening the flexor digitorum longus (FDL) and soleus muscles. Two groups with prior MTSS symptoms will be compared, one group of five collegiate track and field athletes will participate in the exercise program and another five will not. Each subject in the participating group will perform strengthening, endurance, and proprioceptive exercises for the FDL and soleus muscles, six exercises total. These exercises will be performed 3 times a week, for 3 months prior to in season training. A global rating of change scale (GROC) will be used after the study and an independent group t-test will be used to analyze the results between the two groups. The results from this study could then be used to improve our understanding on how to prevent this injury.

 <b>Abstract:</b> The <i>Amaranthus species</i>, a well distributed C-4 annual herbaceous plant, a classified weed of agriculture in North America, Central America, and Europe, is under study due to its invasiveness which has inhibited crop yields to up to 50% in the lower states of the United States. The overuse of chemical herbicides has caused certain species to become resistant to ALS inhibitors, EPSP inhibitors, photosystem II inhibitors, and PPO inhibitors. Varied species of <i>Amaranthus</i> will be grown and a comparison will be made to identify their potential invasive and herbicide tolerance qualities. <i>Amaranthus palmeri</i> glyphosate resistant, <i>Amaranthus palmeri</i> glyphosate susceptible, <i>Amaranthus viridis</i>, <i>Amaranthus hypochondriacus</i>, <i>Amaranthus caudatus</i>, and <i>Amaranthus tricolor</i>. Their growth and germination rates will be measured and contrasted for future invasiveness. Organic herbicides are the focus of this research due to their low environmental impact. A previously studied non-selective organic herbicide, acetic acid which strips away leaf's wax layer and causes oxidative stress, will be used in conjunction with selective organic herbicides okanin and eucalyptus oil. Okanin, known to inhibit the enzyme Glutathione reductase in C4 <i>Amaranthus retroflexus</i>, provides a secondary protection for oxidative stress. Eucalyptus oil causes an allelopathic potential as oxidative stress in seeds and roots of <i>A. viridis</i>. The results of the application of the organic herbicides of the <i>Amaranthus spp</i>. will be compared and evaluated as a viable alternative to current herbicides. Further research will be needed to study the long-term effects of these chemicals on environment, physiological and biochemical mechanism of action. (<i>word count: 247</i>)<br>

 Since the industrial revolution, carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration has nearly doubled in the atmosphere and most of the CO2 emissions are linked to power plants. With the increasing population, the demand for fossil energy poses a serious threat to the ozone layer. Over the last few decades, the society is coming to accept the impacts of CO2on the environment, some steps have been taken to reduce the emissions. However, there still remain large quantities of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Currently, much research is being done to decrease CO2 through direct air capture (DAC) from ambient air. This study presents the state of the emerging technologies for DAC and different methods which can be implemented for CO2 capture from the ambient air. Varieties of solvent absorbents such as basic solvents, and solid adsorbents such as polyamine-functionalized materials and metal organic frameworks (MOFs), will be discussed. In our research group, solid adsorbents polyethylenimine (PEI)-impregnated titanate nanotubes (PEI-TNTs) is being used to capture CO2 from flue gas emitted from a power plant. The adsorbent is also suitable for DAC. The studies for CO2 capture from compressed air utilize the adsorbents at different temperatures. The captured CO2 will be released from the adsorbent at 100-110°C through a temperature swing process. The obtained concentrated CO2 can be used as a product for greenhouse or other industrial applications. The effect of the CO2 adsorption temperature on the CO2 capture dynamics and capacity will be explored. <br>

 Since the collapse of the I-35W bridge over the Mississippi River in 2007, there have been several research studies conducted to accurately and/or conservatively estimate the strength of gusset plate connections of steel truss bridges. In this paper, the authors compared a simple and conservative method proposed by Hill et al. (2014) and the evaluation methods proposed by White et al. (2013). White et al. (2013) developed two slightly different methods to evaluate gusset plate strengths. Both methods have been adopted to the AASHTO (American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials) Manual for Bridge Evaluation, 2nd Edition, with 2015 Interim Revisions. For comparisons, the example connection configuration provided by Hill et al. (2014) and a number of examples from White et al. (2013) are used. The calculated results by White et al. (2013) and Hill et al. (2014) were visualized, compared, and scrutinized by ABAQUS, a software to visualize, classify, and calculate the strengths of the structure. Finally, this paper drew a conclusion on which method is a more applicable and reasonable way to be adopted to the formula of calculating gusset plate through the results of ABAQUS.<b></b><br>

 A techno-economic analysis is described that compares process alternatives for the production of 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BDO) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) based upon either fossil-fuel or sustainable bio-based feedstock. 1,4-BDO is widely used as an intermediate in various industrial products, such as polyether diols, urethane polymers and polyester polymers. THF is commonly used as the monomer for the manufacturing of poly(tetra methylene ether) glycol, which is used to produce spandex stretch fibers, polyurethane elastomers and copolyester-polyether elastomers. The various processes considered here include the following: (1) BioAmber's process in which renewable-derived succinic acid is used to produce 1,4-BDO and THF using novel heterogeneous hydrogenation catalysts; (2) the classical Reppe process where formaldehyde reacts with acetylene to produce 1,4-butanediol; (3) the Davy process where maleic anhydride is esterified and later hydrogenated to produce a mixture of 1,4-BDO, THF, and -butyrolactone; and (4) the DuPont process where maleic anhydride is produced by the oxidation of n-butane, which is subsequently hydrogenated in the form of maleic acid to THF. Aspen Plus™ is used as the process analysis software and for developing the process economics. <br>

<br>
 Tire sites are successful breeding sites for mosquitoes due to variety of factors. Tire sites provide female mosquitos sufficient shade that is attractive for laying eggs. In addition, the dark color of the tires allows heat to be absorbed and provides adequate temperatures for larval mosquito growth. These factors along with location in urban areas and high volume of discarded tires are a perfect recipe for high density populations of mosquitoes. Unfortunately, these factors also make tire sites very difficult to keep mosquito populations under control. We conducted an assessment of the efficacy of the current capabilities (vehicle mounted mist and ultra-low volume sprayers) of the vector control program of the San Antonio Metropolitan Health District in controlling mosquitoes at an abandoned tire site on the south side of San Antonio, TX. One week prior to insecticide application we used 10 BG-Sentinel® Traps to collect mosquitoes which were then taken back to the lab and identified. Two-weeks post-insecticide treatments traps were set in same locations. We collected a total number of 1840 female mosquitoes, 1766 were <i>Aedes albopictus.</i> Using a paired t-test, we found that there was no significant difference in mosquito numbers between pre and post-insectide treatments. We also found that the distance from the entrance to the facility had an effect on the number of mosquitoes trapped with fewer mosquitoes captured at distances further from the entrance to the tire site than closer to the entrance. This trend was present in both pre- and post-treatment collections, but significant only on the pre-treatment date (P=0.03). We concluded that the application of liquid-form insecticides by vehicle-mounted sprayers at the large abandoned tire facility in South San Antonio, during the month of June, 2017 was ineffective. It is likely that the city's current application method is not sufficient to reach all potential breeding sites. <br>

 Introduction:<br>
<br>
 Some studies conducted on military recruits point to the possibility of body mass, aerobic fitness, and activity levels of recruits being risk factors in musculoskeletal injuries in the military recruits. The Army has recently implemented a program called the Performance Triad which includes sleep, activity, and nutrition. It is thought that if a person has all three aspects of this triad then they will be a better soldier and be less likely to get hurt. This study will look at sleep, activity, and BMI to determine if any relation exists between these factors and performance improvement. This study is needed to support the theory of implementing the Army's Performance Triad. We hypothesize that recruits who are getting adequate sleep, maintaining reasonable activity levels, and a decrease in body mass will progress faster in their performance levels than their compatriots. <br>

 Statistical Analysis:<br>
<br>
 Analysis of results will present each component (sleep, body mass, HR during activity, average steps per day) will be correlated with amount of improvement in a cadet's physical performance.<br>

 There is growing interest in growing organic strawberries in southeast Texas because of the premium price for organic berries. However, fungal diseases and insects are problematic in this region because of the climate. Previous studies have shown that crop losses to the tune of 90% are possible. This implies that economic production of strawberries will only be possible with effective disease and pest control programs. Hence the goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of a commercially available organic and conventional pesticide on yield of strawberry cultivar Festival grown in a high tunnel and field environments. Festival was established using bare roots obtained from a commercial nursery and was treated using the same combinations and rates of organic and conventional fungicides and insecticides in the high tunnel and field. The organic combination was RootShield Plus fungicide + Suffoil-X insecticide and BotryStop fungicide while the conventional combination was Ridomil Gold SL fungicide + Topsin alternated with Pristine fungicides + Malathion insecticide. The results show that the strawberry in the high tunnel was nine days earlier compared to the field and the yields were more than two times higher. The conventional treatment yielded the least under the two growing environments.<br>

 When treating expressive language disorder in children with autism, incorporating play treatment can increase functional language skills. Play treatment effectively engages the child to expand their expressive language. Therefore, it is important to join together professionals who work with children with autism, in order to educate them on the benefits of a play based technique. By gathering information from peer-reviewed journal articles over the past 5 years, this review of the professional literature will serve to comprehensively interpret these treatments to indicate important strategies and techniques that has seen a difference in the patient's outcome when collecting data from treatments over the years. The data that has been collected will focus on young children from both genders and have a diagnosis of autism. In addition, the research will discuss advantages on using play based treatments to increase expressive language for children with autism. Educators that work in the public school system and speech-language therapists will be educated on how to incorporate play based treatments or interventions resulting in the most effective outcome for young children with autism.

 The nursing academic route is distinct in its demanding curriculum and clinical requirements. Nontraditional students are defined as students who have children, military personnel, ethnic and racial minorities, those who have a previous degree or career, and those who are socio-economically underprivileged (Merrill, Reinckens, Yarborough, &amp;Robinson, 2006). The current nursing shortage has put pressure on many educational institutions to increase the nursing workforce. As such, the need to identify possible challenges for nontraditional nursing students is a growing concern.
<br>
<br>
 Despite research on nontraditional students, the challenges faced by nontraditional nursing students have not been well studied. The nursing curriculum integrates classroom and clinical components which may present added challenges to students. Attrition rates for baccalaureate nursing programs are averaged to be about 50% nationally (Harris, Rosenberg, &amp; O'Rourke, 2014). This study explores the lived experiences of nontraditional nursing students pursuing a bachelor's in nursing. A mixed methods-exploratory study was conducted utilizing interviews consisting of open-ended questions and surveys including the Student Adjustment to College Scale and a demographic survey. Interviews were analyzed for themes and data collected from the questionnaires aid in identifying factors that posed a challenge to nontraditional nursing students.
<br>

 Researchers hoped to gain insight to the specific challenges faced by nontraditional nursing students in order to tailor specific support programs that boost retention and alleviate the nursing shortage present in the Coastal Bend.

<br>
 Authors: <u>Alyssa Lahmon</u> and Jolena Waddell</strong><br>
<br>
 The purpose of this research is to develop better tools for selection and breeding decisions within a captive white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) program. Using information from a deer ranch in central Texas, we are focusing on inbreeding levels, birth weights as a predictor of mature body weight, and antler scores. Linebreeding and inbreeding are common in captive white-tailed herds, but will decrease genetic diversity in the population, thus increasing the possibility of undesirable recessive traits appearing. In this study the albino trait expressed in a fawn was traced through ancestry utilizing pedigree records to discover trait origins. Knowing the carriers of the albino trait will allow for better management decisions to avoid this phenotype. Birth weights of fawns can be indicative of increased survivability and vigor. We also plan to use birth weight as a predictor of mature body size, as larger deer are more desirable, but weights are rarely measured beyond birth in captive deer. Expected progeny difference (EPD) calculations for birth weight will be determined using direct birth weight records (ranging from 1.08-11.8 lbs), pedigrees, and established heritability estimates from related species. Correlations between birth weights and mature weights will be analyzed for all animals that have records to determine if this will be a beneficial predictor. The most valuable trait in captive white-tailed deer is antler size. Utilizing antler shed collections and Photoshop scaling measurements, individuals are compared using the Boone and Crocket scoring system. By creating an accurate measurement procedure from photographs, it will be easier to accurately phenotype male antlers, thus allowing EPD calculations for antler traits such as tine length and width. These three traits are important for our captive breeder partner and will allow better selection, survival, and production of superior white-tailed deer.<br>

 Abstract
<br>
</strong><br>
 In higher education's world of rising costs and shrinking funds, universities are facing tremendous pressure to innovate. As a result, progressive institutions have sought to leverage student data for increased business insights through the promise of improved efficiency and effectiveness resulting from predictive analytics (Ekowo &amp; Palmer, 2017). Through use of student demographics, past performance data and a host of varied factors models have been shown capable of predicting the future behavior of students, a critical outcome of predictive analytics in the student life cycle (Eduventures, 2013). This is particularly important in the areas of learning outcomes, recruitment, and retention. The current study utilized predictive analytics in relation to two innovative approaches: a non-traditional, online delivery, competency-based education (CBE) model; and a shift in scholarship awarding process. Results show that the CBE model was able to break negative historical persistence patterns, reducing both time and costs to degree completion in comparison to the traditional transfer student population. Through the innovative approach, students were able to accelerate degree completion by at least a year, resulting in up to 53% financial savings. A second use of predictive analytics in creation of a scholarship awarding process has shown promise in driving diversity among new students. Shifting institutional awarding policies from standard test scores to high school percentiles has positively impact minority student applications, and shows promise in increasing overall retention for our first-time freshmen students. The results of these predictive analytics scenarios show that the use of predictive analytics has the potential to alter the landscape in which higher education institutions operate by allowing institutional stakeholders to make better and more informed business decisions that can improve access and success for students nationwide.

 <a name=""_gjdgxs""></a>Strategic Air Traffic Management (ATM) aims to mitigate air traffic congestion by planning traffic flows at a long look-ahead time to better allocate resources. However, managing traffic at this strategic time scale is challenging due to the wide possibilities of uncertain convective weather, which is one of the main causes of traffic delays. To quickly develop effective ATM solutions that are robust to uncertain weather, one way is to use predicted weather scenarios to retrieve similar historical scenarios, tagged with corresponding ATM solutions, from the database, and then fine tune retrieved solutions to derive one that is suitable for the current situation. To enable such a data-driven decision-making strategy, we developed an efficient similarity search technique to rapidly retrieve similar spatiotemporal scenarios from the database. The spatiotemporal scenario data, with weather as a typical example, represents a new data type that has been rarely investigated. Such data, typically extracted from large-scale physical processes of spatiotemporal spread dynamics, have unique features different from typical spatiotemporal pointwise data that have been widely studied. Shifting from the lack of study on spatiotemporal scenario data, we investigate the unique features of this new data type and exploit innovative query algorithms based on data characteristics to achieve fast scenario retrieval. Comprehensive experiments were conducted using real weather scenario data to illustrate the good performance of proposed approaches. <br>

 The purpose of this research is to convert algae, <i>Chlorella</i>,<i> </i>to bio-oil through hydrothermal liquefaction. This particular algae blend is readily accessible, and can be produced on a large scale. The production of bio-oil from <i>Chlorella </i>provides a solution to the exploitation our planet's nonrenewable resources by accelerating the natural process of oil production - theoretically making oil a “renewable resource”. The further study of catalytic effects on the hydrothermal liquefaction has led to higher yields of oil with similar energy content of about 34 KJ/g based on CHNO analysis and bomb calorimetry. Catalysts tested include homogeneous catalysts, such as Ca(NO3)2 with 1, 2, and 5% loadings, and heterogeneous catalysts, such as Y Zeolite of 1, 2, and 5%. The reaction temperatures range from 275 to 350ºC. The reaction results with 1-2% of Ca(NO3)2 at 350ºC produced oil with a percent yield of 29.35% (1% catalyst) and 25.54% (2%). The same catalyst with different loadings (1, 2, and 5%) were also tested at 275ºC and produced bio-oil of 25.60%, 17.07%, and 13.23% respectively. 1% Y zeolite yielded 30.90% and 35.17% of bio-oil at 300ºC.

 <b>Abstract</b><br>
<br>
 During the Upper Cambrian, the North American craton was inundated with the shallow seas of the Sauk transgression. Evidence of this fluctuating shoreline can be seen in the tidal, near shore deposits of the Lion Mountain Sandstone member in Burnet, Texas. This glauconitic sandstone is the uppermost exposed member of the Riley Formation, and are part of the oldest exposed sedimentary rocks in Texas. The clastic constituents of the outcrop consist primarily of rounded, frosted quartz grains and glauconite pellets. These clastic deposits are interpreted as having eroded from the unconformable basement granites and gneisses of the craton. Interbedded sequences of silts, shales, and dolomitic to partially-dolomitized lenses permeate the green sandstone. The Lion Mountain sand has been interpreted as tidal flat and shallow marine shelf depositional environments as evidenced by preserved sedimentary structures and fossils. Herringbone cross-bedded structures in particular are numerous at the study site, and reinforce the high energy, tidal depositional model. The study site differs in several ways from established literature, however, with a complete absence of trilobite fossils and burrows.<br>

<br>
 Ischemic Stroke is the leading and the fourth cause of the adult disability and the death in the US, respectively. Intermittent hypoxic conditioning (IHC) could be a potential intervention for the brain damage caused by ethanol (EtOH) withdrawal. 
<b>Methods:</b> Mouse microglia cells (EOC20) were cultured in the DMEM supplemented with 10 % FBS and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. EOC20 cells exposed to the 2 cycles of EtOH toxicity and withdrawal which consisted of EtOH (100mM) for 16 hours followed by EtOH withdrawal for 8hrs. Prior to the IHC FBS was deprived for 2 hrs and 3 rounds of IHC were conducted in the automatic O2 controlled chamber. Cell viability was evaluated with Calcein AM assay. Anti inflammatory (M2) and pro-inflammatory phenotype (M1) phenotype of EOC20 cells were analyzed using flow cytometry and imunocytochemistry (ICC). The expressions of mRNA of proinflammatory cytokines were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. Potential regulatory proteins for the phenotype shift of EOC20 were quantified by immunoblot analysis.  <b>Results:  </b>IHC has protective effects on the microglia cells which are shown by the significant increase in cell viability vs. EtOH withdrawal. IHC increases protein contents of HIF-1alpha and anti-apoptotic protein kinases.  The mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF alpha in IHC group show a decrease. <b>Conclusion:</b> IHC protects the microglia against EtOH-withdrwal toxicity by activating anti-apoptotic protein kinase. This IHC-induced protective mechanism is linked to the microglia phenotype shift to the M2.<br>

Several different algorithms were used to determine the epoch of minima. The results from bisection of chords method was adopted to derive new ephemeris using the method of generalized least squares. Period analysis did not show any appreciable change in period therefore, the adapted period of 0.31007997 days +/- 4.7E-08 was used to derive the light curve. This paper presents the details as well as the initial efforts to model the orbit of the binary star with the help of Wilson-Devaney model.<br>",
