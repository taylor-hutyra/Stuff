Very useful info for the sport management world. Would have been neat if you could have provided some examples of how participating universities have implemented changes based on your research. It was a little difficult to hear at times but think it was partly because the room was fairly noisy.  Be careful with some grammar issues in the abstract. Nicely done.,"You had great information.

Also, if you had such a good experience that the company obviously appreciated, it would be good to show some kind of information that you compiled to present to your university department on the value of adding an internship as a degree requirement. Incorporate more research to support the good that you discovered because as you said, every internship is different. Since they are different, are the majority of them going to be worth requiring? I certainly believe so but show us!! Nice job of introducing yourself and having a good presence when you present.","Overall good. Might consider decreasing picture size so it’s not so pixalated.

"Jordan, Michael",Texas A&M University - Kingsville,majordan@gmail.com,Dr Shaukat Goderya,Goderya@tarleton.edu,"Poster doesn't have abstract,  jumps straight into observations. Not clear from poster what was achieved and what else needs to be done, although the presenter was knowledgeable. ",not very specific as to the content and the objectives ,,,,
"Szteiter, Shelby",Texas A&M University - Kingsville,Shelby-5495@hotmail.com,Dr. Elda E. Sanchez,Elda.sanchez@tamuk.edu,"Poster - use higher resolution graphics, larger text on graph axes, less overall text. Presentation - thorough but heavy on acronyms and specialized vocab without defining, and overly practiced, which came off as fast and bored. Don't pop your knuckles even though you might be nervous. Abstract is comprehensive. ",,,,,
