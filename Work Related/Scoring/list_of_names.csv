 Students on college campuses around the country are becoming more vocal about food insecurity and homelessness on their respective campus. As a result, the number of Food Pantries on college campuses are multiplying. While there is no official count, membership in the College and University Food Bank Alliance has quadrupled in the past two years (CUFBA, 2016). 
<br>
<br>
 The problem of food insecurity and homelessness is becoming more common among college students in the US population as a whole in which 14% of households experience food insecurity each year. According to a study conducted by Dubick, Matthews, and Cady (2016) which looked at the prevalence of hunger on PWI campus' (predominantly White institutions), 48% of the students surveyed identified as food insecure and 57% of those who were self-identified as “food insecure"" were African Americans. In addition, 64% percent of “food insecure"" students were also experiencing housing insecurity.
<br>
<br>
 The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of food insecurity and homelessness among students at a southern Historically Black University, located in a identified food desert, to address the gap in research that exist regarding this phenomenon among HBCUs. Overall, 74% of the participants (N=569, .05 confidence level) reported knowing someone who has experienced hunger during their time on their HBCU campus and 61% reported to know someone who had experienced homelessness while attending the HBCU. Correlation analysis did indicate the higher cost of the purchased meal plan the more food insecure an individual was. Implications of the study will be discussed.
